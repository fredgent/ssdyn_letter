The application of artificial viscosity in shocks is a necessary numerical 
device to resolve the discontinuity in the momentum equation when using finite 
differences and the authors have validated its application in Gent et al. 2020,
as well as earlier work by, for example, Stone and Norman 1992. Our previously
published tests (Gent PhD 2012, Gent et al 2013 and Gent et al 2020) 
were all purely hydrodynamical, and we showed that
%MJK but we have dropped it out from the energy equation as well, right?
%MJK Is this prone to get the referee agitated again?
%FAG I think we just expalin why we do use them still while dropping induction
%FAG where we have no justification to use.
shock diffusion in the continuity and energy equations were 
necessary for numerical stability to reproduce the Sedov Taylor and 
Snowplough solutions for supernova remnants. 
Inclusion of the shock resistivity in Gent et al 2013 was based on the
assumption that it would also be required for numerical stability without
systematic testing. In Gent et al 2013 this was insufficient to suppress the
small-scale dynamo. In the context of setting up our SSD experiments, however,
tests with and without the shock resistivity were conducted. With shock
resistivity magnetic fields at the shocks were substantially suppressed, while
without shock resistivity the tests passed without problems, and showed
no signs of numerical instability. From these experiments we concluded that the
shock resistivity was not necessary for numerical instability, against our
earlier expectations, and that more physical results are obtained without.
This motivates our choice in the SSD experiments reported in this Letter. 
We are planning to include these MHD tests into a more extensive manuscript on
the SSD characteristics in the warm and hot phases.

As requested by the referee we have conducted an additional experiment with 1pc
resolution and Pm=10, but with shock resistivity included in the model. We
attach a plot for the editor and the referee, but not for inclusion in the
letter, which confirms that the SSD persists, but with reduced growth rate and 
lower saturation level than the model without shock resistivity. We hope this
now satisfies the referee and editor that the SSD in our models is in fact 
physical and not due to numerical instability due to shocks. The differences in
the solutions can be explained by the rapid destruction of magnetic field due to 
unnecessary enhanced shock-resistivity.
We attach a slice of magnetic energy for both models at the same time and
location. Both models are clearly numerically resolved, and the largest 
difference occurs at the shell of the newly exploded SN, where magnetic energy
is reduced when shock resistivity is used. This also explains the lower
saturation, where the equilibrium between dynamo growth and turbulent diffusion
occurs at a lower energy. We also conclude that the divergence term in the
induction equation should not be included because it is not necessary. 
Any artificial numerical devices should be avoided, where possible,
which would materially alter the turbulent properties of the magnetic field.

Noted.

The mean density in all models remains 1 ppcm. It is evident from our inspection
of the snapshots that magnetic field at some times and locations is stronger in
hot diffuse regions than in the warm denser regions. The frozen-in assumption
therefore does not apply. Analysis and explanation of this behaviour is
complicated and requires extensive further investigation.

In addition to this written response, we have aesthetically modified the
y-axis labels in Figure 5 to span two lines, but otherwise resubmit the letter
trusting the evidence and arguments offered satisfy the residual doubts.

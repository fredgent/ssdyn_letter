We have revised the text extensively, both to respond to the details below and
to improve readability, narrative structure, and correct use of terminology.

We relied too heavily on reference (to Gent et al. 2020) rather than a 
self-contained description of our method for inclusion of a shock-capturing 
artificial viscosity, compounded by neglecting to explicitly include several 
of the relevant terms in equations (1)-(4).  We now make the inclusion of 
a set of shock capturing artificial diffusivities (the zeta terms) explicit 
in the text.  We further  include the correction terms for momentum 
and energy conservation, which are applied to compensate for artificial 
mass diffusion.  This well-tested artificial viscosity method accurately captures 
shock discontinuities while conserving mass, momentum, and energy appropriately 
(as explicitly shown in Gent et al. 2020).  The sixth-order hyperdiffusion is applied 
only to suppress instabilities at the grid scale, and is indeed unsuited to 
resolving shocks.  We separately vary the physical (Lagrangian) resistivity eta 
and viscosity nu to study the small scale dynamo action.

We further note that there was likely further confusion because we described
the simpler isothermal model of Section 2 in the same paragraph, as well as 
inaccurately describing it as using only Equations 2 and 4. We have separated 
the description of the isothermal model to a new paragraph and corrected the 
description to note that it does indeed  solve the continuity equation (Eq 1), 
though without the unnecessary shock-capturing artificial diffusion terms.

The objective of Sect. 2 is to clarify the differences between tangling and
dynamo amplification, given the existence of extensive informal debate within 
the community about whether Balsara's results exhibit tangling only, due to 
the imposed field in that study. For this purpose, only a simple experiment 
is required and we relate our physically motivated experimental results to this 
for confirmation that they are indeed produced by the action of a dynamo.
The Federrath papers are relevant, and we include them in our discussion, 
although they do not consider tangling, which is the point of the simplified 
model. We have emphasised in the revision this purpose.  Finally, we have 
corrected the description to acknowledge that we do indeed solve the continuity 
equation (Eq 1) here, but not the energy equation (Eq 3), as this experiment 
is isothermal.

We have included these relevant references in the introduction in the context 
of larger-domain but lower-resolution simulations, similar to those recently 
published by Steinwandel et al.

There are two issues to consider here.  The first is whether the field growth
we see is due to numerical artefacts.  As noted, we have indeed included 
appropriate diffusivities to ensure numerical stability. We further note below
that we have now included our reproduction of Balsara et al.'s work, as well
as several runs with physical viscosity as well as resistivity included.  
We have included the kinetic and magnetic energy spectra that specifically 
demonstrate that the flow and magnetic field are well resolved,
with the energy cutoff clearly occurring well away from the grid scale. 
Therefore, we argue that there is strong evidence of the physical nature of
our results.

The second issue is the referee's assertion that a steady exponential growth 
is a prerequisite for identification of a small scale dynamo. This diagnostic 
is based on consideration of idealized experiments with uniform driving that 
do not have the multiphase, intermittent properties of the supernova-driven ISM.

.... end of Mac Low revisions ...
Given that we do 
not have access to the kinematic velocity fields of real galaxies, we cannot 
be sure that there is ever any neat exponential phase for a volume averaged
magnetic field. That said, there are certainly substantial periods of dramatic 
exponential growth that we argue clearly demonstrate the action of a small scale 
dynamo during those periods.

We have also taken care to illiminate numerical effects, which is why we have
implemented the hyper diffusivity in addition to the shock-dependent
diffusivity. 

Erratic behaviour can have a physical explanation, due to the evolving thermal
properties of the ISM and low (0.2x) supernova rate, and is evident in the
models of LSD in the ISM from both the Pencil Code and the Nirvana code, with
SN rates comparable to the solar neighboruhood. We see the same qualitative
behaviour in models with varying levels of physical viscosity, which we have
added to refute the referee's diagnosis that the effects are numercial due to
inadequate viscosity. As the SN rate increases the filling fraction of the hot
gas becomes dominant and the kinematics more spatially uniform, so that the
energetics become more steady. Consequently the exponential growth is more
uniform and faster.

We have substantially reordered Section 4 and included subheadings to better 
identify the key objectives and outcomes of the experiments. Some additional 
remarks have been necessary to address the models with explicit viscosity and
comparisons to Balsara et al. We therefore have cut some of the discussion about
Rm and Re, which we do not explicitly measure in this letter.

We opted to use lower supernova rates in these experiments to remain in a 
regime which retains a typical distribution of warm and hot phase ISM. In a 
confined periodic box there is no escape for the over pressured gas, as in a 
real galaxy, so the ISM is subject to thermal runaway, in which the filling 
fraction of hot gas exceeds 90%. We now provide results, in which we replicate
the experiments of Balsara et al. The have runs with 0.78, 1.56 and 3.12 pc
resolution. As can be seen our models do show clear exponential growth, but
much faster than Balsara at each resolution. The explanation is due to the
improved accuracy and lower diffusivity of the Pencil Code. Our 3.12 pc
resolution model, matches closely the results of Balsara's 1.56 pc run.

The Balsara experiments used 8x the solar neighbourhood rate for SN injection.
This results in the rapid saturation of the simulation by hot gas and
consequently a steadier kinetic energy profile. Compare the kinetic energy
profiles between the Balsara replicas and the 0.2x SN rate Figure 5. 
%FAG we can do this?
We also provide snapshots of temperature for the 8x, 1x and 0.2x SN rate, and
from this you will see that the characteristics of the ISM are substantially 
altered with the former having gas mainly hotter than 10^7 K.

Addiitional information regarding the revision:
We have revised the text extensively, with the changes highlighted by color
font.
Figure 1 has been updated for style.
Figure 2 has an additional panel (c) displaying results from Balsara et al and
our comparison solutions.
Figure 3 (previously 5) has been updated with rescaling of k and selection of
spectra now from the same simulation time t=27.5 Myr (a -- c), and additional 
spectra from models with viscosity of 0.001 (b) and (c). In (d) we include a
Balsara comparison model with dx=1.56.
Figure 4 (previously 3) has been rearranged and additional panels (c1) and (c2)
now include explicit viscosity models. Two of these profiles are included in
(a2) to emphasise that the variable growth patterns are not due to a lack of
viscosity.
Figure 5 (previously 4) has the latter two panels replacing spectra from 
the 0.5pc fiducial model with eta=0.001 replaced by the 0.78pc Balsara 
comparison spectra.

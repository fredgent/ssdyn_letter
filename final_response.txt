Apart from the example, it is unclear to what the referee refers, but we have
revised the text extensively, both to respond to the details below and hopefully
to improve readability and narrative.

This is not correct. We have validated the implementation of the pencil code of
our convergence proportional diffusivities for handling shock discontinuities in
Gent, F. A., Mac Low, M. M., KÃ¤pylÃ¤, M. J., Sarson, G. R., & Hollins, J. F.
2020, Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics, 114, 77 and these are
included explicitly in Eqs 1, 2 and 3. The hyper diffusion is applied only to 
suppress instabilities at the grid scale, and the terms involving zeta resolve
the strong shocks. Also, the application of cooling and heating, which are a
crude simplification of the physical processes in the context of a monatomic
gas, exclude energy conservation of the ISM.

We now make the inclusion of shock handling explicit in the text and the
correction terms for momentum and energy conservation, which are applied to
compensate for artificial mass diffusion. The reference to Section 2 using only
Eq 2 and 4 may have confused the referee, so we have separated the comment to a new paragraph and explicitly refer to the simplified model, and indeed it was an
error to state we omitted Eq 1 in Section 2, because this is solved, without the
artificial diffusion and the text has been corrected.

The objective of Sect. 2 is to clarify the differences between tangling and
dynamo amplification, given some informal debate within the community about
whether Balsara's results exhibit tangling only, due to the imposed field. For
this only a simple experiment is required and we relate our physically motivated
experimental results to this for confirmation that they are indeed dynamo.
The Federrath papers are relevant, and we include them in our 
commentary, although they do not consider tangling, which is the point of the
simplified model. We have emphasised in the revision this purpose.

We have included reference in the intorduction in the context of the larger

The referee's assertion that a steady exponential growth is a prerequisite for
acceptance of dynamo is debatable. Such behaviour is based on physical systems
without the multiphase properties of the ISM, with less sporadic forcing regimes
as we present here. Given that we do not have access to the kinematic phases of
real galaxies, we cannot be sure that there is ever any neat exponential phase
for a volume averaged brms type quantity. 'accepted' does not necessarily equate
with a truth! Reality can indeed be complicated, so can anybody be sure about
the exponential phase for the entire galaxy? 

We have also taken care to illiminate numerical effects, which is why we have
implemented the hyper diffusivity in addition to the shock-dependent
diffusivity. We have included the kinetic and magnetic energy spectra,
specifically to demonstrate that the flow and magnetic field are well resolved,
with the energy cutoff clearly applying well away from the grid scale. 

Erratic behaviour can have a physical explanation, due to the evolving thermal
properties of the ISM and low (0.2x) supernova rate, and is evident in the
models of LSD in the ISM from both the Pencil Code and the Nirvana code, with
SN rates comparable to the solar neighboruhood. We see the same qualitative
behaviour in models with varying levels of physical viscosity, which we have
added to refute the referee's diagnosis that the effects are numercial due to
inadequate viscosity. As the SN rate increases the filling fraction of the hot
gas becomes dominant and the kinematics more spatially uniform, so that the
energetics become more steady. Consequently the exponential growth is more
uniform and faster.

We have substantially reordered Section 4 and included subheadings to better 
identify the key objectives and outcomes of the experiments. Some additional 
remarks have been necessary to address the models with explicit viscosity and
comparisons to Balsara et al. We therefore have cut some of the discussion about
Rm and Re, which we do not explicitly measure in this letter.

We opted to use lower supernova rates in these experiments to remain in a 
regime which retains a typical distribution of warm and hot phase ISM. In a 
confined periodic box there is no escape for the over pressured gas, as in a 
real galaxy, so the ISM is subject to thermal runaway, in which the filling 
fraction of hot gas exceeds 90%. We now provide results, in which we replicate
the experiments of Balsara et al. The have runs with 0.78, 1.56 and 3.12 pc
resolution. As can be seen our models do show clear exponential growth, but
much faster than Balsara at each resolution. The explanation is due to the
improved accuracy and lower diffusivity of the Pencil Code. Our 3.12 pc
resolution model, matches closely the results of Balsara's 1.56 pc run.

The Balsara experiments used 8x the solar neighbourhood rate for SN injection.
This results in the rapid saturation of the simulation by hot gas and
consequently a steadier kinetic energy profile. Compare the kinetic energy
profiles between the Balsara replicas and the 0.2x SN rate Figure 5. 
%FAG we can do this?
We also provide snapshots of temperature for the 8x, 1x and 0.2x SN rate, and
from this you will see that the characteristics of the ISM are substantially 
altered with the former having gas mainly hotter than 10^7 K.

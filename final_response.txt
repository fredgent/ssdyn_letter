Dear Editor:

We thank the referee for their careful, if critical, review of our study. This
has led to substantial revisions and improvements, which we believe will 
relieve all the concerns of the referee, as detailed below.

We have revised the text extensively, both to respond to the details below and
to improve readability, narrative structure, and correct use of terminology.
As is evident from the changes indicated with color font, a majority of our original 
text has been revised.

We relied too heavily on reference (to Gent et al. 2020) rather than a 
self-contained description of our method for inclusion of a shock-capturing 
artificial viscosity, compounded by neglecting to explicitly include several 
of the relevant terms in equations (1)-(4).  Therefore, we now make the inclusion of 
a set of shock capturing artificial diffusivities (the zeta terms) more prominent 
in the text.  We further include the missing correction terms for momentum 
and energy conservation, which are applied to compensate for artificial 
mass diffusion.  This well-tested artificial viscosity method accurately captures 
shock discontinuities while conserving mass, momentum, and energy appropriately 
(as explicitly shown in Gent et al. 2020).  The sixth-order hyperdiffusion is 
applied only to suppress instabilities at the grid scale, and is indeed unsuited 
to resolving shocks.  We separately vary the physical (Lagrangian) resistivity eta 
and viscosity nu to study the small scale dynamo action, as we now explicitly 
include.

We further note that there was likely further confusion because we described
the simpler isothermal model of Section 2 in the same paragraph, as well as 
inaccurately describing it as using only Equations 2 and 4. We have separated 
the description of the isothermal model to a new paragraph and corrected the 
description to note that it does indeed solve the continuity equation (Eq 1), 
though without the unnecessary shock-capturing artificial diffusion terms.

The objective of Sect. 2 is to clarify the differences between tangling and
dynamo amplification, given the existence of extensive informal debate within 
the community about whether Balsara's results exhibit tangling only, due to 
the imposed field in that study. For this purpose, only a simple experiment 
is required and we relate our physically motivated experimental results to this 
for confirmation that they are indeed produced by the action of a dynamo.

The Federrath papers mentioned are relevant, and we include them in our discussion, 
although they do not explicitly consider tangling, which is the point of the 
simplified model. We have emphasised this purpose more strongly in our revised
text.  Finally, we have corrected the description to acknowledge that we do 
indeed solve the continuity equation (Eq 1) here, but not the energy equation 
(Eq 3), as this experiment is isothermal.

We have included these relevant references in the introduction, in the context 
of larger-domain but lower-resolution simulations, similar to those recently 
published by Steinwandel et al.

There are two issues to consider here.  The first is whether the field growth
we see is due to numerical artefacts.  As noted, we have indeed included 
appropriate diffusivities to ensure numerical stability even in the presence
of strong shocks. We further note below that we have now included a direct 
reproduction of Balsara et al.'s work, as well as several runs including 
physical viscosity as well as resistivity. We see the same qualitative
behaviour in models with varying levels of physical viscosity. We have 
further included kinetic and magnetic energy spectra that specifically 
demonstrate that the flow and magnetic field are well resolved, with the 
energy cutoff clearly occurring well above the grid scale.  Therefore, 
we argue that there is strong evidence of the physical nature of our results.

The second issue is the referee's implied assertion that exponential growth 
must be steady to diagnose small scale dynamo action. This intuition is based 
on consideration of idealized experiments with uniform driving that 
do not have the multiphase, intermittent properties of the supernova-driven 
ISM. Erratic behaviour can have a physical explanation, because of the 
evolving thermal properties of the ISM, particularly at low (0.2x solar 
neighbourhood) supernova rate.  Such behaviour is evident in models of 
LSD in the ISM from both the Pencil Code and the Nirvana code, with SN 
rates comparable to the solar neighbourhood. In our models, there are 
certainly substantial periods of dramatic exponential growth that we 
argue clearly demonstrate the action of a small scale dynamo during 
those periods. As the SN rate increases the filling fraction of the hot
gas becomes dominant and the kinematics more spatially uniform, so that the
energetics become more steady. Consequently the exponential growth is 
indeed both more uniform and faster, though still showing periods of 
faster and slower growth (see, for example Figure 2c in the new version).

We have substantially reordered Section 4 into subsections that focus on 
presenting the key objectives and outcomes of the experiments rather than 
presenting general descriptive material. Some additional remarks have 
been necessary to address the new models with explicit viscosity and
comparisons to Balsara et al. We therefore have deferred to a later 
publication some of the discussion about Rm and Re, which we do not 
explicitly measure in this Letter.

We have now included models in which we explicitly replicate the experiments of 
Balsara et al. These include runs with 0.78, 1.56 and 3.12 pc resolution. 
As can be seen our models do show clear exponential growth, but
much faster than Balsara et al. at each resolution.  This behaviour is
explained by the improved accuracy and lower diffusivity of the sixth-order 
Pencil Code, compared to the second-order Godunov code used by Balsara. 
Our 3.12 pc resolution model matches closely the results of the highest 
resolution 1.56 pc run by Balsara et al.

We opted to use lower supernova rates in most of our models to remain in a 
regime that retains a typical distribution of warm and hot phase ISM. In a 
confined periodic box there is no escape for the over pressured gas, as in a 
real galaxy, so the ISM is subject to thermal runaway, in which the filling 
fraction of hot gas exceeds 90% (see Li et al. 2015 and Gatto et al. 2015, 
both cited in the paper). By comparison, the Balsara et al. models (and our
reproductions of them) use 8x the solar neighbourhood rate for SN injection.
This results in the rapid saturation of the simulation by hot gas and
consequently a steadier kinetic energy profile. This can be seen, for example,
by comparing the kinetic energy spectra between the Balsara replicas and 
the 0.2x SN rate in Figure 5.

We have done so, and hope for a more positive evaluation of the revised text.

Yours,

Frederick Gent, for the authors

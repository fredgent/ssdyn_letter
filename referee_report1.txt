Dear Dr. Käpylä,

I have appended the reviewer's report on this manuscript. As you will see, the reviewer has major concerns about your work and recommends against publication. The referee believes you have neglected to consider some important previous work, and that the methodology of your study is suspect. I am willing to consider a revised version of this manuscript, but only if you can provide a strong rebuttal. 

If you decide to resubmit, please outline the revisions you have made in response to each of the reviewer's comments using plain text in the field provided when you upload the revised manuscript. Citing each of the reviewer's comments immediately followed by your response would be particularly helpful.

Reviewers find it helpful if the changes made to the text in your revised manuscript are easily identified. This can be done by using boldface (for minor changes) or color (for more extensive changes or additions). 

We normally expect a revision to be submitted within about 6 weeks. Please let us know if you anticipate any delay.

Regards,
Ethan T. Vishniac

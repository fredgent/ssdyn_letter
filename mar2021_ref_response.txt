We have added a new Figure 2 with 2D slices of magnetic energy and gas density. As well as demonstrating the artificial dissipation of compressed magnetic
energy, both models show the field enhancement is independent of the gas 
density distribution and shock handling. We include the time series of the 
model with shock resistivity in panel b1 of Figure 5. Revised text is indicated 
in color font. We appeal to the editor for latitude to include one excess
panel and 185 excess words to resolve the outstanding requirements of the
referee.

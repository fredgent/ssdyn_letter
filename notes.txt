Figure 1 include right axis - normalised time averaged kinetic energy density
All figures with magnetic energy density include normalised value
Figure 2 - add dx in the plots (latex) top left - replace eB axes with common values
run 4pc 1sigmaSN to saturation and add note to caption not common time axes
use myr for time axes
same y axes for fig 3 and 4

18/08
Panel a fig 5 single y-axis, clearer caption, log time axis to show linear growth of tangling
check whether high Pm number is covered in Haugen et al
Panels b and c time in caption.
urms bar to be defined in caption.
repeat c with high resolution as b

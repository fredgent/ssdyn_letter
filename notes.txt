Figure 1 include right axis - normalised time averaged kinetic energy density
All figures with magnetic energy density include normalised value
Figure 2 - add dx in the plots (latex) top left - replace eB axes with common values
run 4pc 1sigmaSN to saturation and add note to caption not common time axes
use myr for time axes
same y axes for fig 3 and 4

Panel a fig 5 single y-axis, clearer caption, log time axis to show linear growth of tangling
check whether high Pm number is covered in Haugen et al
Panels b and c time in caption.
urms bar to be defined in caption.
repeat c with high resolution as b

01/09
define B_Eq in text
Fig 1 b and c use compensated spectra
reduce inset to 30--50 time units
replot fig 1a, fig 2 and 3 e_B/bar e_k

false convergence Fig 2b 2 and 4 vs 1 and 0.5
Fricksel false convergence
Fig 2 and 3 include 0.1 in y-axis

Fig 4 remove extra y-axis  get tick marks inwards on all four sides

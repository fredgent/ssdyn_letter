\begin{abstract}
We present a numerical resolution study over a range of magnetic Reynolds
number (Rm) to identify characteristics of the small-scale dynamo (SSD) under
supernova-driven turbulence of the interstellar medium (ISM).
We confirm that conditions in the ISM are likely highly conducive to 
SSD in the diffuse hot and warm turbulent ISM, given Rm in the real ISM is 
orders of magnitude higher than we model at our highest resolution and modest
SN explosion frequency ($\SNr$), 20\% that of the solar neighbourhood.
This is despite the negative impact on SSD expected from the highly compressible
nature of the flow.
We find convergence in the growth rate of the SSD with resolution for a given 
$\SNr$ approaching 
sub-parsec scale and a trend towards the exclusion of SSD for resolution
more coarse than 4 parsecs.
Across the modelled range of 0.5 to 4 parsec resolution we find the SSD 
saturates consistently at about 5\% of the energy equipartion level, independent
of the growth rate.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}


To be revised \ldots

This letter addresses the recent results of \citet{GE20}, which asserts the 
absence of a small scale (fluctuation) dynamo (SSD) in the interstellar medium
(ISM) subject to supernova induced turbulence and multi-phase structure
applicable to the solar neighbourhood. 
They refute the earlier dynamo solutions of \citet{BKMM04}

\end{figure*}

In many simulations of supernova driven turbulence with realistic vertical 
stratification \citep[e.g.,][]{deAvillez:2005,PO07,Hill:2012a,HI14} the mechanisms
for inducing large scale magnetic fields are absent, such as rotation and shear.
To examine the effect of strong ordered magnetic fields these models then rely
on imposition a background or initial magnetic field, typically uniform,
which is then perturbed by supernova explosions.
The amplification of the magnetic field in these cases may include a small
scale dynamo in case of sufficently high magnetic Reynolds numbers, but any
amplification of the large scale field is limited to linear growth through
tangling of the imposed field.
Any initial large scale field would diffuse leaving only the random field. 
If an imposed field is sufficiently close to equipartition its characteristics
would dominate any MHD results.

More commonly models of supernova driven dynamo in the ISM have ignored the 
large scale effects and examined the small scale dynamo or the effect of the
turbulent magnetic field on the properties of the ISM
\citep[e.g.,][]{BKMM04,BalKim05,MacLow:2005}.
A seed or imposed field for such models could be uniform or random, but if the
simulated field results from tangling rather than dynamo, then any conclusions
about the ISM depend on the veracity of the chosen field rather than the 
nature of the MHD turbulence.

To illustrate some differences between tangling and small scale dynamo we adopt
a toy model with non-helical random forcing with wavenumber $\kf=8$ applied to
isothermal uniform density in $256^3$ $2\pi$-periodic boxes.
A uniform field with energy density $e_B\simeq6\cdot10^{-22}\overline{e_K}$ is
imposed, where $\overline{e_K}$ is the time-averaged kinetic energy density.
The two simulations are distinguished only by use of $\eta=10^{-4}$, exciting a 
small scale dynamo models, and $\eta=2\cdot10^{-3}$ subcritical for dynamo.
Our numerical implementations use the {\sc Pencil Code}\footnote{
\url{https://github.com/pencil-code}}.

We plot some of the diagnostics from the results of these two simulations in 
Figure\,\ref{fig:tangling}.
Panel (a) illustrates that the small scale dynamo 
is characterised by exponential growth \fag{Nishant, please add some relevant citation to this expected behaviour}, growing over 10 orders of magnitude in 
just over 400 eddy turnover times.
Tangling results only in linear amplification
early on (see inset), saturating within 100 eddy turnover times at below 5 times
the imposed field energy density.

In panel (b) we plot for the SSD model some power spectra for the magnetic
energy, evolving over time alongside a kinetic energy spectrum at late stage.
The magnetic energy spectra are compensated by $k^{-3/2}$ and kinetic by
$k^{5/3}$.
A profile becoming horizontal, therefore, corresponds to the Kazentsev 
\fag{Anyone, a suitable reference for this expected behaviour?} $3/2$ inverse
cascade power law or Kolmogorov turbulent energy cascade.
In panel (c) see we show similar for the tangling model.
The forcing scale $\kf=8$ is evident in the kinetic spectra and highlighted by 
a vertical dotted line.
The SSD magnetic spectrum (b) evolves near self-similarly, with an 
uncompensated peak
wavenumber above 20 at early times reducing to below 20 upon saturation of the
dynamo.
The forcing scale has negligible effect on the magnetic spectra.
However, for the tangling case (c) the peak wavenumber for the magnetic energy
spectrum is strongly identified with the forcing scale.
The Kazentsev range of the spectrum extends to wavenumbers larger than the 
forcing scale for SSD, while confined to larger scales for the field with
tangling only. 

Given the high magnetic Prandtl numbers, the magnetic spectra retain more energy
at smaller scales than the kinetic spectra.
Although the kinetic parameters are identical and are subject to the same 
viscous cutoff, the SSD extends the kinetic energy into the larger scales
due to the feedback from the Lorentz force.
With SSD there is a short inertial range for $10\leq k/k_1\lesssim 15$.
Thus, in the dynamo kinetic energy deposited along the Kolmogorov range to
smaller scales transfers energy to the magnetic field at these scales
inducing an inverse Kazentsev range begining at scales below the forcing
scale, while with tangling the energy tranfers to the magnetic field
only at scales between the forcing scale and scale of the imposed field.
There is only dissipation of the field at scales smaller than the Kazentsev 
range.


\section{SN turbulence model design} \label{sec:model}

While in the SN experiments considered in this letter are restricted to
SSD, some large scale models do include the large scale dynamo
\citep[e.g.,][]{Gressel:2008,HWK09,WA09,Gent:2013b,EGSFB16,Pakmor17,SBADMN19,SDLMBP20,GE20}.
Most of these do not include a small scale dynamo.
\citet{Gent:2013b,EGSFB16} do include SSD, but without a clear understanding of
the characteristics of this SSD it is difficult to explore the effect this has
on the large scale dynamo (LSD) and the properties of the ISM.
In this letter we explore the SSD in realistic simulations of SN driven 
turbulence.
The resolution and parameter study is intended to identify the critical ranges
for excitation of SSD and understand dynamo growth rates and saturation 
conditions.
This will also identify the prerequisites for including or excluding SSD in the
LSD models and subsequently establish the importance of SSD-LSD interactions 
on galaxy dynamics. 


To exclude any large scale magnetic field dynamics in these simulations, the
computational domain occupies a cube of length 120 pc, with periodic boundaries
on all sides. 
We solve the system of non-ideal compressible MHD equations, including 
mass Eq\,\eqref{eq:mass}, momentum Eq\,\eqref{eq:mom}, energy Eq\,\eqref{eq:ent} and
induction Eq.\,\eqref{eq:ind}:
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  \begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:mass}
    \frac{D\rho}{Dt} &=& 
    -\vect\nabla \cdot (\rho \vect{u})
    +\vect\nabla \cdot\zeta_D\vect\nabla\rho,\\
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  \label{eq:mom}
    \rho\frac{D\vect{u}}{Dt} &=& 
    \vect\nabla{\ESK\sigma}
    -\rho c_{\rm s}^2\vect\nabla\left({s}/{c_{\rm p}}+\ln\rho\right)
    +\vect{j}\times\vect{B}
    \nonumber\\
    &+&\vect\nabla\cdot \left(2\rho\nu{\mathbfss W}\right)
    +\rho\,\vect\nabla\left(\zeta_{\nu}\vect\nabla \cdot \vect{u} \right)
    \nonumber\\
    &+&\vect\nabla\cdot \left(2\rho\nu_3{\mathbfss W}^{(3)}\right),\\
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  \label{eq:ent}
    \rho T\frac{D s}{Dt} &=&
     \EST\dot\sigma +\rho\Gamma
    -\rho^2\Lambda +\eta\mu_0\vect{j}^2 
    \nonumber\\
    &+&2 \rho \nu\left|{\mathbfss W}\right|^{2}
    +\rho\,\zeta_{\nu}\left(\vect\nabla \cdot \vect{u} \right)^2
    \nonumber\\
    &+&\vect\nabla\cdot\left(\zeta_\chi\rho T\vect\nabla s\right)
    +\rho T\chi_3\vect\nabla^6 s,\\
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  \label{eq:ind}
    \frac{\partial \vect{A}}{\partial t} &=&
    \vect{u}\times\vect{B}
    +\eta\vect\nabla^2\vect{A}
    +\eta_3\vect\nabla^6\vect{A},
  \end{eqnarray}
completing the system with the equation of state for an ideal gas.
Many symbols have their usual meaning, and a table is included in the appendix
for clarity.
In particular, terms containing $\zeta_D,\,\zeta_\nu$ and $\zeta_\eta$ are the
application of artificial diffusion acting proportional to shocks in 
Eqs.\,\eqref{eq:mass},\,\eqref{eq:mom} and \eqref{eq:ent}, respectively.
This machinery is described in detail in \citet{GMKSH20}, which is included to
resolve shock discontinuities.
Shock diffusion is not applied to Eq.\,\eqref{eq:ind}, where it would result in 
unphysical dissipation of the magnetic field in the shock fronts, when in fact 
here it is highly enhanced by compression.
In Eqs.\,\eqref{eq:mom} -- \eqref{eq:ind}, expressions containing 
$\nu_3,\,\chi_3$ and $\eta_3$ apply sixth-order hyperdiffusion applying primarily
at the grid scale to resolve small-scale instabilities.

The supernovae are injected randomly uniform in 3D space and as a
Poisson process proportional to the solar neigbourhood rate in the Milky Way,
 $\SNr\simeq 50\kpc^{-3}\Myr^{-1}$. 
Each explosion injects $10^{51}\erg$ as thermal energy, $\EST$, but in 
dense media a small proportion may be in kinetic energy, $\ESK$.
This is described in detail by \citet{GMKSH20}.
Non-adiabatic heating, $\Gamma$, and cooling, $\Lambda$, processes are included
following \citet{Wolfire:1995} and \citet{Sarazin:1987}, as described in 
\citet{Gent:2013a}. 

In the subset of experiments presented in this letter we set viscosity, $\nu=0$,
with $\nu_3$ applying optimally for each resolution to ensure the flow is 
well resolved.
We establish a benchmark for the magnetic field evolution setting $\eta=0$, with
numerical resistivity acting via the optimal setting for $\eta_3$.
We then vary $\eta\geq10^{-6}$ to identify minimal range for which the physical
resistivity is dynamically dominating the numerical resistivity, and examine the
dependence of the dynamo on $\nu$ and grid resolution. 
In contrast to our earlier experiments \citep{Gent:2013a,Gent:2013b,GMKSH20},
we do not include thermal diffusivity, $\chi$, in these experiments as 
the artificial diffusivities are adequate to ensure numerical stability and
the physical effects of thermal conductivity can be expected to be relevant only
at time and spatial scales much shorter than considered here.

At 4\,pc resolution the models with $\eta=10^{-4}$\,kpc\,km\,s$^{-1}$ are 
continued until the dynamo has saturated, for comparison with the higher 
resolution saturation levels.
\label{fig:eb-nu}}
\end{figure*}

In Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-res} the response of the magnetic energy density 
$e_B/\overline{e_K}$ to resolution is shown
for resistivity $\eta=10^{-4}\kpc\kms$, panel\,(a) and
$\eta=10^{-3}$, panel\,(b).
The time in Myr is plotted on a log scale to better present the differences in 
the higher resolution runs, which saturate much faster then the 4 pc resolution 
run.
Whilst for $\eta=10^{-4}$ the dynamo growth rates are very slow at 4\,pc
resolution, the growth rate shows some convergence near 0.5\,pc resolution and 
the saturation level of above 5\% of $\overline{e_K}$ is independent of
resolution. 
At $\eta=10^{-3}$, there is a \emph{false convergence} \citep{FMA91}
between 2 and 4\,pc resolution,
with the magnetic energy decaying at similar rates, however at higher resolution
we see that the results converge around an alternative solution, with a dynamo
amplification of the field occurring between 400 and 600\,Myr.

In Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-nu} we show how at each resolution $e_B/\overline{e_K}$
evolves for various values of $\eta$.
We note that at 0.5, panel (a), and 1\,pc resolution, panel (b), the profile
at $\eta=10^{-5}$ is indistinguishable from $\eta=0$, and so numerical
resistivity continues to control the dynamics.
At $\eta=10^{-4}$ the dynamo diverges from $\eta=0$, such that physical resistivity
is dynamically dominant, at least for some of the domain and Rm is unevenly
defined by combination of physical and numerical resistivity.
At all resolutions $\eta=10^{-3}$ is clearly well resolved and dynamics and
Rm well defined by the physical application of resistivity.
To reduce statistical noise, at all resolution and $\eta$ the supernova are
scheduled at the same time and coordinates for $\dot\sigma=0.2\SNr$, panels (a) -- (d), and for $\dot\sigma=\SNr$, panels (e) -- (f).
For low resolution the timestep is longer, such that the actual timing and 
environment of the explosions can differ between models, so the statistical
noise is more evident, particularly in panels (e) and (f). 

The evolution is complicated by the impact \emph{thermal runaway}
\citep[see e.g.,][]{LOCBN15}, combination of multiple SN into superbubbles
resulting in persistent hot regions.
We shall report analysis of these results in depth in future work, but an 
initial observation of the growth profiles could lead to the conclusion that
growth rates for high resistivity (low Rm) can exceed comparable rates for high
Rm, in contradiction to dynamo theory and previous experimental results.
Closer inspection of each plot, zooming in on specific intervals, however,
confirms that growth rates are higher as expected for higher Rm.
For example between 8 and 15 Myr there is weak growth or decay in panels (a)
and (b) with critical $\eta$ for dynamo between $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$.
Rm and corresponding growth at low $\eta$ is higher in the 0.5\,pc simulation
with lower numerical resistivity, but 
converge for $\eta=10^{-3}$, where the physical resistivity is most resolved.
Between 15 and 20\,Myr there is a fast dynamo driven in the hot gas, in which
growth rates are related to the level of resistivity.
The high Rm models at 0.5\,pc already saturate by 20\,Myr, but for 1\,pc there
is another slow dynamo driven in the warm gas up to 40\,Myr and then a
subsequent 'hot' dynamo resulting in saturation for all models within 60\,Myr,
including for $\eta=10^{-3}$.

At low resolution, with $\dot\sigma=0.2\SNr$ panels (c) and (d), $\eta=10^{-4}$
is not distinct from numerical resistivity, and there is no hot dynamo at all
for 4\,pc resolution with the well resolved $\eta=10^{-3}$.
At 100\,Myr there is a hot dynamo at 2\,pc resolution, but this is not
sustained and for $\eta=10^{-3}$ susbequently diffuses away.
At $\dot\sigma=\SNr$, panels (e) and (f), the increased Rm due to the 
higher forcing rate is sufficient to produce a dynamo at $\eta\geq10^{-3}$, but
not for $\eta=5\cdot10^{-3}$.
Given the increased statistical noise we cannot confirm that $\eta\leq10^{-4}$
applies beyond the numerical resistivity.
However, at 2\,pc resolution, $\eta=5\cdot10^{-4}$ is resolved and at 4\,pc
resolution $\eta=2\cdot10^{-4}$ is near the resolved limit, both plotted as
magenta lines.
In panel (e) we see two hot dynamo phases at 90  and 110\,Myr, which are not 
present in panel (f).
There is a reduced susceptibility to thermal runaway at low resolution, 
and only lower Rm can be resolved, both an effect of more diffusive numerics.
Hence, as the resolution becomes more coarse it is likely that the small-scale 
dynamo will be suppressed in simulations of the ISM.
Higher supernova rates driving increased velocities may permit coarse models 
to attain the critical Rm for SSD, but it is likely that models with 
resolution much above 4\,pc will suppress the dynamo. 

To attain a truly convergent numerical regime simulations should apply 
resolution better than 2\,pc.
In the ISM with Rm much higher than we can resolve, our results confirm that a
SSD is very easy to excite by SN, and may even be present in galaxies with
low SN rates.
As shown in panels (a) and (b), properties of the hot gas cannot exclude 
SSD even with high resistivity in galaxies that produce sustained regions of
hot turbulence.
We shall examine the nature of this fast dynamo in a later report.
To exclude SSD in SN driven turbulence simulations will require
$\eta\gtrsim10^{-3}$ or supernova implementation which avoids thermal runaway.
In \citet{Gressel:2008,GE20}, the resolution is 8.3 and 6.7\,pc, respectively
and $\eta\simeq6.5\cdot10^{-3}\kpc\kms$, which excludes SSD,
while \citet{Gent:2013b} applied $\eta\simeq8\cdot10^{-4}\kpc\kms$ with 4\,pc
resolution, which would support SSD, even without thermal runaway.
The latter obtain a large scale dynamo with a $\Omega=\OSN$, where 
$\OSN=25\kms\kpc^{-1}$ is the galactic angular momentum in the solar
neighbourhood, while the
former require $\Omega\geq4\OSN$ to excite LSD.
Rm applying at the largest scales would be 7.5 times higher for the latter 
model, so alone is sufficient to explain the LSD.
How the SSD affects the galactic dynamo requires further study.

In contrast to the toy model in Section\,\ref{sec:ssd-tang}, SN driven
turbulence does not have a well-defined forcing scale, due to the heterogeneous
temperature and density of the ISM and random clustering of explosions.
In our simulations the forcing scale will range between 10 and 50\,pc,
or $k\in(3,16)$.
In Figure\,\ref{fig:4power} we show the evolving compensated spectra for the
high resolution kinetic energy in the kinematic phase (b) for $\eta=10^{-4}$
and during decay (d) for $\eta=10^{-3}$.
The spectra magnitude show the same fluctuations over time, except at 32\,Myr,
when the dynamo saturates and reduces slightlye of the energy in (b) compared
to (d). 
Many of the spectra display a \emph{bottleneck} effect \fag{reference tba} with
a peak at $k\simeq50$.
The compensated magnetic energy spectra in panels (a) and (c) have ranges 
conforming to the Kazentsev inverse cascade in the SSD case (a) extending to
$k\gtrsim 20$, consistent with the SSD behaviour of the toy model in
Figure\,\ref{fig:tangling}\,(b).
In panel (c) of Figure\,\ref{fig:4power} the Kazentsev range in similar fashion
to Figure\,\ref{fig:tangling}\,(c) is in the range $K\lesssim10$ except
for 22\,Myr, which corresponds to a short growth spurt in
Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-res}\,(b) and consistent with the presence of SSD.

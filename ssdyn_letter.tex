\begin{abstract}
Magnetic fields appear to grow quickly even at early cosmological
times, suggesting the action of a small-scale dynamo (SSD) in the
interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. Previous studies have focused
on idealized turbulent driving of the SSD. We here simulate more
realistic supernova-driven turbulence to determine whether it can
drive an SSD.  We vary the physical resistivity (and thus the magnetic
Reynolds number), as well as the numerical resolution and supernova
rate to delineate the regime in which an SSD occurs.
We find convergence in the growth rate of the SSD with resolution approaching 
sub-parsec scale for a given supernova explosion frequency
$\dot\sigma$. Across the modelled range of 0.5 to 4 parsec resolution we find that with
sufficiently low resistivity the SSD saturates consistently at about 5\% of
the energy equipartion level, independent of the growth rate. Dynamo
growth rates for $\dot\sigma=\SNr$, the solar neighbourhood rate, relative to models with
$\dot\sigma=0.2\SNr$, are greater despite higher Mach numbers.
This is despite the negative impact on SSD expected from the highly compressible

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
%==============================================================================
\fag{Perhaps here, first a paragraph addressing the importance of MF in the ISM
at all}

%MJK The landscape to me seems to be the following:
%MJK GE20 do not explicitely state that they do not have SSD, but do go forward with QKTFM, which assumes that no magnetic background turbulence is present, hence they make an implicit claim of having no SSD.
%MJK Balsara04 clearly had an SSD, as LSD was not allowed for, but had an imposed
%MJK field, and the role of that is unclear.
%MJK Fred+gang claim LSD and SSD, but it is unclear whether this is true, as
%MJK separating SSD and LSD is difficult.
%MJK Steinwandel et al. have recently claimed that an SSD is present in a
%MJK galactic-scale simulation, but no LSD, and that SSD "dies" off at later
%MJK stages, when Kazantsev scaling is not observed.
%MJK So, our study now tries to address at which resolution a fully healthy
%MJK SSD can be expected in a full ISM simulation, and helps to interpret
%MJK the mess descripbed above.
%MJK Now we DO not have imposed field, and can confirm the conclusions of Balsara04
%MJK without it.
%MJK It would be interesting if a critical Rm could be nailed down, but I doubt we

%FAG 28.9 reword

This letter addresses the necessary conditions for and nature of a small-scale
dynamo (SSD) in the interstellar medium (ISM).
The SSD consists of dynamo modes acting at small eddy scales of the
turbulence, so it drives magnetic field growth at the corresponding short
turnover times.
There are large scales of separation between the fastest growing SSD
instabilities and the large-scale dynamo (LSD) modes generating the magnetic
field structures organised at the systemic scales of the galactic disk, spiral
arms, or similar.
As such, simulations capable of capturing the LSD alongside the faster
growing modes of SSD are computationally challenging.
However, it is likely that the interaction of SSD modes with the LSD
fundamentally alter the evolution and structure of the magnetic field.

In many simulations of supernova (SN) driven turbulence with realistic vertical 
stratification \citep[e.g.,][]{deAvillez:2005,PO07,Hill:2012a,HI14} the
mechanisms for inducing large-scale magnetic fields, such as rotation and shear,
are absent.
To examine the effect of strong ordered magnetic fields these models then rely
on imposition of a background or initial magnetic field, typically uniform,
which is then perturbed by SN explosions.
The amplification of the magnetic field in these cases may include an SSD in
case of sufficiently high magnetic Reynolds numbers, Rm, but any amplification
of the large-scale field is limited to linear growth through tangling of the
imposed field.
The fluctuations can then undergo either linear or exponential growth
depending on the absence or presence of an SSD.
Any initial large-scale field would diffuse leaving only the random field. 
If an imposed field is sufficiently close to equipartition its characteristics
would dominate any MHD results.
On the other hand, the magnetic noise produced by tangling
will grow exponentially if the system supports the LSD instability.
Such a noise plays an important role in quenching the LSD by contributing
to the magnetic $\alpha$-effect $\alpha_M$, which leads to the saturation
of large-scale fields in the nonlinear regime.
%MJK Is this paragraph now too complicated? Should we only try to highlight the aspects relevant here? I am not sure how much text we can have here in the first place...
%FAG OK

%MJK The previous para was about neglecting the LS effects, and this paragraph continues on the same topic. Is this really intended? I guess we could get a rid of this simply. I understand models referred to above have vertical stratification and those below not, but cannot we simply group them together? Btw, stratification alone and even boundary conditions that are inhomogeneous in the vertical, can of course drive some sort of a dynamo effect, but definitely not of the type we believe to take place in the galaxies. Does anybody see a way how to reconcile this?
More commonly, models of the SN-driven dynamo in the ISM have ignored the 
large-scale effects and examined the SSD or the effect of the
turbulent magnetic field on the properties of the ISM
\citep[e.g.,][]{BKMM04,BalKim05,MacLow:2005}.
A seed or imposed field for such models could be uniform or random, but if the
simulated field were the result of tangling rather than dynamo, then any
conclusions about the ISM would depend on the veracity of the chosen field
rather than the nature of the MHD turbulence.

While the SN experiments considered in this letter are restricted to SSD, some
large-scale models do seek to include the LSD
\citep[e.g.,][]{Korpi:1999b,Gressel:2008,HWK09,WA09,Gent:2013b,EGSFB16,Pakmor17,SBADMN19,SDLMBP20,GE20}.
%FAG: -> SSD a->an I read ess ess dee and I think this is the correct way to handle acronyms
%Most of these do not include a small-scale dynamo.
Most of these do not include an SSD.
\citet{Gent:2013b,EGSFB16} do appear to include SSD, but without a clear
understanding of the characteristics of this SSD it is difficult to explore the
effect this has on the LSD and the properties of the ISM.
\citet{SBADMN19,SDLMBP20} also claim that SSD is present in a galactic-scale
simulation, but do not excite LSD. 
At late stage the SSD ceases, as shown by
the disappearance of Kazantsev scaling in the magnetic power spectra.

Given the uncertainty over the presence of SSD in the large-scale simulations
we seek to confirm how to identify, quantify and characterise SSD, so that we
can adequately interpret its action in simulations of LSD.
\citet{BKMM04} report SSD in ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), but with only
numerical diffusion and a limited set of resolution and parameters it was not
possible for them to demonstrate convergence of the solutions nor dependence on
Rm or magnetic Prandtl number, Pm.
They include a weak imposed uniform field; we shall show that it is possible
to demonstrate conclusively that the amplification of their field is a result of
dynamo action and not just tangling of the field.

%FAG: para break
In this letter we explore the SSD in realistic simulations of SN driven 
turbulence in isolation from any drivers of LSD.
The broad resolution and parameter study is intended to identify the critical
ranges for excitation of SSD and understand dynamo growth rates and saturation 
conditions.
This will also identify the prerequisites for including or excluding SSD in the
LSD models and subsequently establish the importance of SSD-LSD interactions 
on galaxy dynamics. 
We aim to find objective criteria with which to determine the presence of SSD
in simulations \citep[such as][]{Gent:2013b,GE20,SBADMN19}.

\section{Disentangling the dynamo} \label{sec:ssd-tang}
%==============================================================================

To illustrate some differences between tangling and SSD we adopt a simplified
model with non-helical random forcing with wavenumber $\kf/k_1=8$ applied to
isothermal uniform density in $256^3$, $2\pi$-periodic boxes with $k_1=1$ being
the lowest wavenumber in the domain.
A uniform field with energy density $e_B\simeq6\cdot10^{-22}\overline{e_K}$ is
imposed, where $\overline{e_K}$ is the time-averaged kinetic energy density.
The two simulations are distinguished only by use of dimensionless
$\eta=10^{-4}$, exciting an SSD, and $\eta=2\cdot10^{-3}$
subcritical for dynamo.
These yield Rm=148.0$ with Pm=50.0$ for the SSD and Rm=7.4 with Pm=2.5 where
the dynamo is suppressed and amplification is limited to tangling of the
imposed magnetic field.
%FAG: moved to intro
%Our numerical implementations use the {\sc Pencil Code}\footnote{
%\href{https://github.com/pencil-code}{https://github.com/pencil-code}}.

We plot some of the diagnostics from the results of these two simulations in 
Figure\,\ref{fig:tangling}.
Panel (a) illustrates that the SSD is characterised by
exponential growth just over 400 eddy turnover times; see \cite{ZRS83} for the
properties and excitation conditions of SSD.
Tangling results only in linear amplification early on (see inset), saturating
within 100 eddy turnover times at below 5 times the imposed field energy
density.

In panel (b) we plot for the SSD model some power spectra for the magnetic
energy, evolving over time alongside a kinetic energy spectrum at late stage.
$k$ is normalised by $k_1=L/(2\pi)$, where $L$ is the largest length scale in
the simulation domain, with the largest wavenumber $k/k_1=128$.
The magnetic energy spectra are compensated by $k^{-3/2}$ and kinetic by
$k^{5/3}$.
A profile becoming horizontal, therefore, corresponds to the Kazantsev's
$3/2$ scaling \citep{Sch02,BS14} or the Kolomogorov turbulent energy spectrum.
In panel (c) see we show similar for the tangling model.
The forcing scale $\kf=8$ is evident in the kinetic spectra and highlighted by 
a vertical dotted line.
The SSD magnetic spectrum (b) evolves near self-similarly, with an uncompensated
peak wavenumber above 20 at early times reducing to below 20 upon saturation of
the dynamo.
The forcing scale has negligible effect on the magnetic spectra.
However, for the tangling case (c) the peak wavenumber for the magnetic energy
spectrum is strongly identified with the forcing scale.
The Kazantsev range of the spectrum extends to wavenumbers larger than the 
forcing scale for SSD, while confined to larger scales for the field with
tangling only.

Given the high magnetic Prandtl numbers, the magnetic spectra retain more energy
at smaller scales than the kinetic spectra.
Although the kinetic parameters are identical and are subject to the same 
viscous cutoff, the SSD extends the kinetic energy into the 
smaller scales
due to the feedback from the Lorentz force.
%With SSD there is a short inertial range for $10\leq k/k_1\lesssim 15$.
%MJK Is there not also for the tangling case?
%FAG: I say not add clarification
With SSD there is a short inertial range in the kinetic spectrun 
for $10\leq k/k_1\lesssim 15$, whereas in the tangling model the spectrum is
decaying already at $k/k_1\gtrsim10$.
%MJK Why in Fig 1 the y-scales are so much different when eb/ek is close to one?
%FAG the spectra are integral quantities and all the kinetic energy is concentrated around k=8, which biases the peak value for eK and also there are the k-power prefactors
Thus, in the dynamo kinetic energy deposited along the Kolmogorov range to
smaller scales transfers energy to the magnetic field at these scales
inducing an inverse Kazantsev range beginning at scales below the forcing
scale, while with tangling the energy transfers to the magnetic field
only at scales between the forcing scale and scale of the imposed field.
There is only dissipation of the field at scales smaller than the Kazantsev 
range.

\section{SN turbulence model design} \label{sec:model}

To exclude any large-scale magnetic field dynamics in these simulations, the
computational domain occupies a cube of length 256 pc, with periodic boundaries
on all sides.
In particular rotation, shear and stratification of the simulation domain are
not included.
There is no imposed field, in contrast to \citet{BKMM04}, so we can exclude
tangling as a source of amplification of the sub-nG initial random seed field.
Grid size $\delta x=0.5$, 1, 2 and 4$\pc$  along each side are considered.
We solve the system of non-ideal compressible MHD equations, including

Many symbols have their usual meaning, and a table (\ref{sec:table}) is
included in the Appendix for clarity.
In particular, terms containing $\zeta_D,\,\zeta_\nu$ and $\zeta_\eta$ are the
application of artificial diffusion acting proportional to shocks in 
Eqs.\,\eqref{eq:mass},\,\eqref{eq:mom} and \eqref{eq:ent}, respectively.
This machinery is described in detail in \citet{GMKSH20}, which is included to
resolve shock discontinuities.
In contrast to \citet{Gent:2013b} shock diffusion is not applied to
Eq.\,\eqref{eq:ind}, where it would result in unphysical dissipation of the
magnetic field in the shock fronts, when in fact in the shocks it is highly
enhanced by compression.
In Eqs.\,\eqref{eq:mom} -- \eqref{eq:ind}, expressions containing 
$\nu_3,\,\chi_3$ and $\eta_3$ apply sixth-order hyperdiffusion applying
primarily at the grid scale to resolve small-scale instabilities
\citep[see, e.g.,][]{ABGS02,HB04}.

The SNe are injected randomly uniform in 3D space and as a Poisson
process proportional to the solar neigbourhood rate in the Milky Way,
 $\SNr\simeq 50\kpc^{-3}\Myr^{-1}$.
Each explosion injects $10^{51}\erg$ as thermal energy, $\EST$, but in dense
media a small proportion may be in kinetic energy, $\ESK$.
This is described in detail by \citet{GMKSH20}.
To reduce statistical noise, at all $\dx$ and $\eta$ the SN are
scheduled at the same time and coordinates for $\dot\sigma=0.2\SNr$ and for 
correspondingly for $\dot\sigma=\SNr$.
Non-adiabatic heating, $\Gamma$, and cooling, $\Lambda$, processes are included
following \citet{Wolfire:1995} and \citet{Sarazin:1987}, as described in 
\citet{Gent:2013a}.

In the subset of experiments presented in this letter we set viscosity, $\nu=0$,
with $\nu_3$ applying optimally for each $\dx$ to ensure the flow is well
resolved.
We establish a benchmark for the magnetic field evolution setting $\eta=0$, with
numerical resistivity acting via the optimal setting for $\eta_3$.
We then vary $\eta\geq10^{-6}\kpc\kms$ to identify minimal range for which the
physical resistivity is dynamically dominating the numerical resistivity, and
examine the dependence of the dynamo on $\eta$ and grid resolution.
Henceforth, where $\eta$ is specified for the SN simulations it has units of
$\kpc\kms$. 
In contrast to our earlier experiments \citep{Gent:2013a,Gent:2013b,GMKSH20},
we do not include thermal diffusivity, $\chi$, in these experiments as the
artificial diffusivities are adequate to ensure numerical stability and the
physical effects of thermal conductivity can be expected to be relevant only
at time and spatial scales much shorter than considered here.
\fag{Mordecai, could you suggest some appropriate reference?}

An important 
parameter for the excitation of the SSD
is the magnetic Reynolds number, Rm,
and the magnetic Prandtl number, $\Pm = \Rm/\Rey = \nu/\eta$, where $\Rey$
is the fluid Reynolds number.
%FAG: added overline for consistency and added eq number as NS suggested
A commonly used definition is 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sRm}
\Rm=\frac{\ell \overline{u_{\rm rms}}}{\eta},
\end{equation}
where $\ell$ is the forcing scale.
However, in these simulations of the ISM, given the 
%MJK ?
%FAG opposit of what I meant - reworded
%Galilean invariance of the 
inhomogeneity of the 
turbulence, variation within hot and warm medium, and inclusion of
hyperdiffusion, defining a single forcing scale from the SN explosions or 
common rms velocity is unreliable.
%MJK "a field" sounds alien to me
%FAG: absolutely no alienation allowed
%We, therefore, directly compute a field of Reynolds numbers from the equations,
We, therefore, compute Reynolds numbers at each grid point
directly from the equations,
for example,
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:Rm}
  \Rm = \frac{\left|\vect{u}\times\vect{B}\right|}{
    \left|\eta\vect\nabla^2\vect{A}+\eta_3\vect\nabla^6\vect{A}\right|}.
\end{eqnarray}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hence, for the high resolution runs at 20\,Myr we obtain for $\eta=10^{-4}$ 
$\langle\Rm\rangle=4.1$ with standard deviation 5.7, whereas using
equation\,\eqref{eq:sRm} 
%FAG: added overline for consistency
$\Rm = 15000$, for $\eta=10^{-4}$, $\ell=50\pc$ and
$\overline{u_{\rm rms}}=30\kms$.
%FAG: added
The spread of Rm, using equation\,\eqref{eq:Rm}, extends well above 15000 and to
$\ll1$.
Given the multiphase structure of the ISM, the mean Rm appears unhelpful and 
the concept of a critical Rm for SSD may differ between phases and regions.
In the real ISM such variation in Rm will be present.
Microscopic resistivity may be temperature dependent \citep{CSR50}, but even if
we consider only the turbulent resistivity as relevant to the definition of 
Rm, this will also vary between phases due to the differences in typical 
length scales and velocities.
We shall address this challenge in future work, but here we shall use the 
explicit input $\eta$ rather than Rm to discriminate between models.
%

In this suite of experiments, with $\nu=0$ and $\nu_3=\eta_3$ sufficient to
numerically resolve the grid scale, $\Pm<1$, which is an even more difficult
regime in which to excite the SSD than in the high $\Pm$
regime typical of the ISM \citep{HBD04}.
In separate experiments with $\nu>\eta$ (high Pm), which we shall include in
the more in depth future analysis, we do in fact see increased growth rates
for lower $\eta$, as expected \citep{Sch07}.
%FAG: added
As with Rm in this system we have a range $Pm\ll1$ and $Pm\gg1$, due to the
inclusion of shock capturing viscosity and differences in the definition of
hyper viscosity to hyper ressitivity.
Hence, in all models some part of the domain will be characterised by high Pm,
and how this effects interpretation of the SSD properties shall also be
addressed in later work.

In Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-res} the response of the magnetic energy density 
$e_B/\overline{e_K}$ to resolution is shown for resistivity $\eta=10^{-4}$,
panel\,(a) and $\eta=10^{-3}$, panel\,(b).
The time in Myr is plotted on a log scale to better present the differences in 
the higher resolution runs, which saturate much faster than at $\dx=4\pc$.
Whilst for $\eta=10^{-4}$ the dynamo growth rates are very slow at $\dx=4\pc$,
the growth rate shows some convergence near $\dx=0.5\pc$ and the saturation
level of around 5\% of $\overline{e_K}$ is independent of resolution.
%MJK How do we know that we currently capture the correct one?
%FAG Not sure to what 'one' you refer?
%MJK To false/true convergence?
At $\eta=10^{-3}$, there is a {false convergence} \citep{FMA91} between
$\dx=2$ and $4\pc$, with the magnetic energy decaying at similar rates, however
at higher resolution we see that the results converge around an alternative
solution, with a dynamo amplification of the field occurring between
%400 and 600\,Myr.
%NS: perhaps you meant 40 and 60; changed, but pls check
40 and 60\,Myr.

In Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-nu} we show how at each resolution $e_B/\overline{e_K}$
evolves for various values of $\eta$.
We note that at $\dx=0.5$, panel (a), and $1\pc$, panel (b), the profile at
$\eta=10^{-5}$ is indistinguishable from $\eta=0$, and so numerical resistivity
continues to control the dynamics.
At $\eta=10^{-4}$ the dynamo diverges from $\eta=0$, such that physical

%FAG: removing Rm
%At all $\dx$ $\eta=10^{-3}$ is clearly well resolved and dynamics and

%equation of $\Rm=15000$ using the common definition. 
At all $\dx$ $\eta=10^{-3}$ is clearly well resolved and dynamics
well defined by the physical application of resistivity.
Although models with the same SN rate have the same schedule and location of
SN, at low resolution the timestep is longer, such that the actual timing and 
environment of the explosions can differ between models, so the statistical
noise is more evident, particularly in panels (e) and (f).


%MJK Would help if it was not introduced as a complication, but explained first as behavior seen in the figure, then given an explanation, and then convincing the reader that what is seen now only in Figs 3 a,b as puzzling, we can easily explain in these terms.

%FAG: added
%The evolution is complicated by the impact \emph{thermal runaway}
%\citep[see e.g.,][]{LOCBN15}, combination of multiple SN into superbubbles
%resulting in persistent hot regions.
Amongst the general suite of simulations in addition to those presented in this
letter, some models exhibit the phenomenon of {thermal runaway}
\citep[see e.g.,][]{LOCBN15}.
The hot gas fills a sufficient fractional volume, that the supernova remnants 
form bubbles, which cannot cool rapidly and the domain becomes saturated 
with hot gas.
Simulations with high resolution are more easily perturbed into this regime, but
also low resolution runs with higher $\dot\sigma$.
We observe that during some phases of accelerated dynamo growth, the magnetic
field is growing most rapidly in the hot gas, whilst during majority of the 
duration of the runs magnetic fields grow most rapidly in the warm gas and the
dynamo growth overall follows a lower exponential.
This is one reason for the complication in characterising the turbulence in 
these SSDs, with Rm, Pm and $u_{\rm rms}$ varying is space and over time.

%FAG removing Rm
We shall report analysis of these results in depth in future work, but an 
initial observation of the growth profiles could lead to the conclusion that
%growth rates for high resistivity (low Rm) can exceed comparable rates for high
%Rm, in contradiction to dynamo theory and previous experimental results.

%FAG: moved to summary
%There is a reduced susceptibility to thermal runaway at low resolution, 
%and only lower Rm can be resolved, both an effect of more diffusive numerics.
%Hence, as the resolution becomes more coarse it is likely that the small-scale 
%dynamo will be suppressed in simulations of the ISM.
%Higher SN rates driving increased velocities may permit coarse models 
%to attain the critical Rm for SSD, but it is likely that models with 
%$\dx$ much above $4\pc$ will suppress the dynamo. 
%
%To attain a truly convergent numerical regime simulations should apply 
%resolution better than $2\pc$.
%In the ISM with Rm much higher than we can resolve, our results confirm that
%SSD is very easy to excite by SN, and may even be present in galaxies with
%low SN rates.

%%FAG para break
%%FAG: moved to summary
%As shown in panels (a) and (b), properties of the hot gas cannot exclude

%%FAG not fast
%%We shall examine the nature of this fast dynamo in a later report.
%We shall examine the nature of acceleration of the dynamo in a later report.
%To exclude SSD in SN driven turbulence simulations will require

%In \citet{Gressel:2008,GE20}, $\dx$ is 8.3 and $6.7\pc$, respectively
%and $\eta\simeq6.5\cdot10^{-3}\kpc\kms$, which excludes SSD,
%while \citet{Gent:2013b} applied $\eta\simeq8\cdot10^{-4}\kpc\kms$ with $\dx=4\pc$,
%which would support SSD, even without thermal runaway.
%The latter obtain a LSD with galactic angular momentum
%$\Omega=\OSN$, where $\OSN=25\kms\kpc^{-1}$ is the rate in the solar
%neighbourhood, while the former require $\Omega\geq4\OSN$ to excite LSD.
%Rm applying at the largest scales would be 7.5 times higher for the latter 
%model, so alone is sufficient to explain the LSD.

In contrast to the simplified model in Section\,\ref{sec:ssd-tang}, SN driven
turbulence does not have a well-defined forcing scale, due to the heterogeneous

In Figure\,\ref{fig:3power} panels (a) -- (f) the effect of resolution on the
compensated energy spectra is shown for $\eta=0$, $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$
with $\dot\sigma=0.2\SNr$.

The time, $19.5\Myr$, of the spectral snapshot
corresponds to a common phase of accelerated magnetic growth for $\dx=0.5$ and $1\pc$.
For $\dx=2$ and $4\pc$ the time 100\,Myr corresponds to a period of accelerated
growth at $2\pc$, which is absent in the $4\pc$ model.
The hydrodynamic parameters are fixed for each resolution and are 
consistent between panels (b), (d) and (f).
We note the convergence in the kinetic energy spectrum for
$\dx=0.5\pc$ and $\dx=1\pc$, apart from the energy cutoff at higher $k$
arising from differences in resolution.
Also, the total kinetic energy is reduced with low resolution due to 
increased viscous dissipation acting at lower $k$.

Many spectra display a {bottleneck} effect
\citep{Falkovich94,HBD03} with a peak at $k\simeq50$.
%MJK Bump would be more descriptive.
There is a bottleneck evident, an energy cascade less efficient than $k^{-5/3}$
terminating at a peak, before rapid dissipation at high $k$.
This bottleneck shifts to lower $k$ as $\dx$ increases, but always at higher
$k$ than the Kazantsev range in the corresponding magnetic spectrum.

Perhaps surprisingly, there is very little difference in the kinetic energy
spectrum, Figure\,\ref{fig:3power}(h), between simulations with
$\dot\sigma=0.2\SNr$ and $\SNr$, despite five times as much energy being 
applied from the forcing in the latter case.
From the models with $\eta=10^{-3}$ it is evident that there is more energy
near the bottleneck in the high $\dot\sigma$ case (cyan dotted line), so more
energy can be tranferred to the SSD.
The comparison is obscured for $\eta=10^{-4}$, because the high $\dot\sigma$
magnetic field is already 3 or 4 orders of magnitude stronger, aquiring some of
the kinetic energy (red dash-dotted line).
More hot gas from the higher SN rate may also improve the efficiency of SSD,
which we shall investigate in future work.  



\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}

%MJK Now the summary (but it could be also outdated)
%MJK does not really address the main results presented in the paper. 
%MJK 1) SSD can be excited without imposed field present in the system, i.e. the confirmation of Balsara results being not caused by the presence of it, as Detlef thought.
%MJK 2) Convergence (and hopefully a true one) in between 0.5 and 1 pc res, and their implication for the previously published simulations.
%MJK 3) General agreement (hopefully) with the picture of growth rate being somehow related to Rm, and some (maybe forcefully handwavy) estimate of the critical value.
%NS: As Balsara paper talks also about helicity, may be we could briefly say
%NS: that this being SSD is unlikely to be affected by the kinetic helicity
%NS: at least the growth rates.
%MJK But do we know this for sure? Have we looked at the helicity?
%MJK In Miikka's paper we find evidence for kin. helicity making SSD much easier to excite.
%NS: Ok, I recall some papers (also by Axel I think) where helical/non-helical cases
%NS: produced identical growth rates, but this is perhaps minor issue here.
%FAG: added
In this letter we confirm, without the use of an imposed magnetic field, that
the field amplification demonstrated by \citet{BKMM04} was evidence of 
SSD in the ISM and not just caused by
tangling of their imposed field.
Through the most extensive resolution and parameter study to date,
%FAG Moved from above
%mm in the ISM with Rm much higher than we can resolve,
we conclude that SN driven turbulence easily excites SSD even at SN
rates well below the Galactic value.
% mm
     Our conclusion is supported by noting that the resistivity of the
     ISM is far smaller than we can resolve numerically, so the ISM is
     far more susceptible to dynamo action than our models.
Our models with $\dx=0.5$ and $1\pc$ with
$\eta=10^{-3}\kpc\kms$ (see
Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-res}b), 
show that a seed field of less than 1~nG can be amplified to saturation at
microgauss levels within about 10\,Myr.

We further show that simulations with insufficient resolution

     lacking dynamo activity.  This can occur because these     
simulations are not scale independent.
The SN energy input and the physically motivated ISM cooling processes impose
length and time scales that must be adequately resolved.
%FAG Moved from above
To
%mm attain a truly convergent numerical regime simulations should apply resolution at least as fine as $1\pc$.
      reach true convergence requires resolution of $1\pc$ or better.
In our models, resolutions $\dx\geq2\pc$ not only give an incorrect dynamo
solution, but also exhibit significant kinetic energy losses due to excess
dissipation.
%
%FAG: added
We do, however find, independent of resolution, that when an SSD is excited it
saturates at about 5\% of the energy equipartition level.
At low resolution this is a lower bound, because the time-averaged
kinetic energy density is understated, due to dissipative losses.
This might account for the discrepency between the energy density of the mean
magnetic field and the random magnetic field in \citet{Gent:2013b}, due to the
LSD being well resolved while the SSD remained under resolved.

%FAG: added
We find that the conventional approach from dynamo theory to categorise the 
turbulence according to Rm based on a forcing scale $\ell$, random velocity and
resistivity, is inadequate for such a complicated system.
The ISM appears to host at least two regimes of SSD, apparently
embedded in the hot or warm phases, and with radically different 
dynamo characteristics and growth rates, and which occupy changing fractional
volumes and epochs.
This is further exacerbated by the susceptibility to thermal runaway, which 
alters the SSD properties.
Explaining the interaction of these SSDs will require more sophisticated
statistical and perhaps toplogical techniques, in advance of being able to 
address how such SSD interacts with LSD.
%FAG Moved from above
Due to the more diffusive numerics there is a reduced susceptibility to
thermal runaway at low resolution. 
Higher SN rates may permit coarse models to enter thermal
runaway and more easily excite SSD, but it is likely that models with 
$\dx$ much above $4\pc$ will suppress SSD in simulations of the ISM.

%FAG Moved from above
To exclude SSD in SN driven turbulence simulations will require
$\eta\gtrsim10^{-3}\kpc\kms$ or SN implementation which avoids thermal runaway.
In \citet{Gressel:2008,GE20}, $\dx$ is 8.3 and $6.7\pc$, respectively
and $\eta\simeq6.5\cdot10^{-3}\kpc\kms$, which in all probabilty excludes SSD.
\citet{Gent:2013b} applied $\eta\simeq8\cdot10^{-4}\kpc\kms$ with $\dx=4\pc$,
which would support SSD with SN rates similar to the solar neighbourhood, even
without thermal runaway.
The latter obtain an LSD with galactic angular momentum $\Omega=\OSN$, where
$\OSN=25\kms\kpc^{-1}$ is the rate in the solar neighbourhood.
The former require $\Omega\geq4\OSN$ to excite LSD.
Rm applying at the largest scales would be 7.5 times higher for the latter 
model, so alone is sufficient to explain the LSD at lower $\Omega$.
%FAG: added
Early efforts by \citet{Korpi:1999b} were unable to detect even the LSD.
With a resolution even less than \citet{Gressel:2008} $\Omega\gg\OSN$ would be 
required to excite the LSD, and an SSD would be ruled out.
%
How the SSD affects the galactic dynamo requires further study.
%FAG added ???? Not sure this is actually so relevant having read it? Though I find it puzzling that they have SSD but no LSD
Using an SPH code \citet{SBADMN19} report an SSD in a global galaxy simulation
with minimum resolution equivalent to about 20\,pc.
In this model the SN are not directly modelled and the turbulence is driven
on a much larger forcing scale by the galactic wind and fountain.
The disk height is relatively small-scale in the model, so the LSD model
to which this letter is a preliminary step, might appropriately fit into
design of a subgrid-scale model for their halo model.
%

%FAG Moved from above
As shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-nu}(a) and (b), turbulence 
can excite accelerated SSD even with high resistivity in galaxies that
sustain regions of hot gas.
To understand this we shall examine the nature of the acceleration of the
dynamo in a later submission.

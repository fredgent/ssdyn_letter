%% For manuscript that include authors in collaborations, AASTeX v6.3
%% builds on the \collaboration command to allow greater freedom to 
%% keep the traditional author+affiliation information but only show
%% subsets. The \collaboration command now must appear AFTER the group

%% is still the collaboration identifier. The text given in this
%% argument is what will be shown in the manuscript. The first argument
%% is the number of author above the \collaboration command to show with
%% the collaboration text. If there are authors that are not part of any
%% collaboration the \nocollaboration command is used. This command takes
%% one argument which is also the number of authors above to show. A
%% dashed line is shown to indicate no collaboration. This example manuscript
%% shows how these commands work to display specific set of authors 
%% on the front page.
%%
%% For manuscript without any need to use \collaboration the 
%% \AuthorCollaborationLimit command from v6.2 can still be used to 
%% show a subset of authors.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
%==============================================================================


 This \mm{L}etter addresses the necessary conditions and properties of a small-scale
 dynamo (SSD) in the interstellar medium (ISM).
 SSD acts at small eddy scales of the turbulence, thus driving magnetic field
 growth at correspondingly short turnover times.
 %FAG: split sentence for readability
 %The fastest growing SSD modes are far smaller than the large-scale dynamo
 %(LSD) modes generating the magnetic field structures organised at the systemic
 %scale of the galactic disk.
 \fg{The large-scale dynamo (LSD) with much longer turnover times generates
 magnetic fields ordered on \mm{kiloparsec} scales.}
 Hence, simulations capable of capturing LSD alongside the faster growing modes
 of SSD are computationally challenging.
 %FAG: trim
 %However, the interaction of SSD modes with the LSD likely fundamentally alters
 %the evolution and structure of the magnetic field.
 However, \fg{interaction between SSD and LSD modes likely
 fundamentally} \mm{determines the} evolution and structure of the magnetic field.

 Many simulations of supernova- (SN)-driven turbulence with realistic vertical
 stratification \citep[e.g.,][]{deAvillez:2005,PO07,Hill:2012a,HI14} have no
 mechanism to induce LSD, such as rotation and shear.
 %FAG: trimmed - limitation sufficiently apparent, removed initial
 %The effect of strong ordered magnetic fields is modelled by initial
 %imposition of a background, typically uniform, magnetic field.
 %If an imposed field is sufficiently close to equipartition, it
 %would excessively influence the results.
 The effect of strong ordered magnetic fields is modelled by
 imposition of a background, typically uniform, magnetic field.
 %FAG: temporarily placed Federrath citations here. Will disucss them separately %FAG: with Balsara or relate to Section 2.
 %FAG: split and concise
 %Some large-scale models do seek to include LSD \citep[e.g.,][]{Korpi:1999b,
 %Gressel:2008,HWK09,WA09,FCSBKS11,FSBS14,RT16,RT17,RT17a,Pakmor17,SBADMN19,GE20}, but most show no SSD.
 %\citet{RT16,SBADMN19} do find an SSD, but no LSD.
 %\citet{Gent:2013b,EGSFB16} do appear to include an SSD.
 \fg{Some large-scale models do seek to include LSD 
 \citep[e.g.,][]{Korpi:1999b,Gressel:2008,HWK09,WA09,Pakmor17,
 GE20}, but show no SSD, or appear to find SSD 
 \citep[e.g.,][]{RT16,SBADMN19}, within the context of halo-disk
 scale flows, but capture no LSD.}
 \citet{Gent:2013b} \mm{and} \citet{EGSFB16} do appear to include an
 \fg{SSD with} \mm{an} \fg{LSD}.
 To confirm this and determine its effect on LSD, we must understand the
 properties of the SSD.
     
 Any magnetic noise produced by tangling \fg{of a large scale field}
 will also grow exponentially due to an LSD if present.
 This noise plays an important role in quenching the LSD due to the magnetic
 $\alpha$-effect, causing saturation of large-scale fields.
 We need to discriminate this effect from an SSD.   

 %FAG: splitting
 %Previous experiments \citep[e.g.,][]{BKMM04,BalKim05,MacLow:2005}
 %examined the SN-driven SSD using ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) with
 %a limited set of resolution and parameters that did not allow
 %demonstration of convergence of the solutions nor dependence on
 %magnetic Reynolds (Rm) or Prandtl (Pm) numbers.
 Previous experiments \citep[e.g.,][]{BKMM04,BalKim05,MacLow:2005}
 examined the SN-driven SSD\fg{, the former of which we shall henceforth
 identify as \BKM}.
 \fg{The limited  resolution} \mm{study} \fg{of \BKM\ did not allow
 demonstration of \mm{solution} convergence.
 Dependence on magnetic Reynolds (Rm) or Prandtl (Pm) numbers was not
 explored due to use of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).}
 They included a weak imposed uniform field; we shall show
 that the amplification of their field is a result
 of SSD action and not just tangling of the field.

%FAG: splitting
%In this letter we compare the SSD to tangling in an idealized simulation
%(Sect.~\ref{sec:ssd-tang}), and then determine its presence in simulations of SN-driven 
%turbulence in isolation from any drivers of an LSD (Sect.~\ref{sec:model}). 
%Our numerical implementations use the {\sc Pencil Code}\footnote{
%\href{https://github.com/pencil-code}{https://github.com/pencil-code}}.
%A broad resolution and parameter study allows us to identify the critical
%resistivity and resolution for excitation of an SSD, and follow the growth to
%saturation (Sect.~\ref{sec:results}).
%This provides objective criteria with which to determine the presence of SSD
%in simulations \citep[such as][]{Gent:2013b,GE20,SBADMN19}.
%Finally, we conclude in Sect.~\ref{sec:conc}.
In this {\mm L}etter we \mm{first} compare the SSD to tangling in an idealized simulation
(Sect.~\ref{sec:ssd-tang})\fg{.

\section{Disentangling the dynamo} \label{sec:ssd-tang}
%==============================================================================

 %FAG: added refs and reworded for clarity
 \fg{Previous SSD studies have examined Pm dependence with \mm{uniform}
 nonhelical forcing, including \mm{at} high Mach number \citep[e.g.,][]{ 
 HBD03,HBD04,Haugen:2004M,FCSBKS11,FSBS14}.}
 %To illustrate differences between tangling and SSD we adopt a simplified
 %model.
 \fg{Here, however, we adopt a simplified model purely t}o illustrate
 differences between tangling and SSD.
 Nonhelical random forcing is applied at wavenumber $\kf/k_1=8$ to
 $256^3$ zone, $2\pi$-periodic, isothermal boxes.
 The lowest wavenumber in the domain is $k_1=1$ and the largest is the Nyquist
 frequency $k/k_1 = 128$.
 The imposed uniform field has $e_B\simeq6\cdot10^{-22}~\overline{e_K}$, where
 $\overline{e_K}$ is the time-averaged kinetic energy density.
 Two simulations are distinguished by use of dimensionless
 resistivity $\eta=10^{-4}$
 and $\eta=2\cdot10^{-3}$ and viscosity $\nu=5\cdot10^{-3}$.
 These yield $\Rm=150$, with $\Pm = 50$, exciting \mm{an} SSD, and $\Rm=7.4$ with
 $\Pm=2.5$, inhibiting the dynamo so that amplification is limited to tangling
 of the imposed field.

 Figure\,\ref{fig:tangling}\,(a) shows the SSD growing exponentially in just over
 400 eddy turnover times; see \cite{ZRS83} for SSD properties and excitation
 conditions.
 Tangling induces only linear growth (see inset), saturating just above
 the imposed field energy within 50 turnover times.

 %FAG: edit for language
 %Power spectra for the magnetic energy of the evolving SSD and
 %tangling model are plotted
 %in Figures~\ref{fig:tangling}(b) and~\ref{fig:tangling}(c), respectively,
 %alongside a late kinetic energy spectrum.
%mm  \fg{Power spectra of the kinetic energy and the
 %evolving magnetic energy are plotted in Figures~\ref{fig:tangling}\,(b) for the
 %SSD and~\ref{fig:tangling}\,(c) tangling.}
 \mm{Figures~\ref{fig:tangling}(b) and~\ref{fig:tangling}\,(c) show
   compensated power spectra for both cases.}
 %FAG: clearer
 %Magnetic energy spectra are compensated by Kazantsev's $k^{3/2}$
 %scaling \citep{Sch02,BS14}, and the kinetic energy by the
 %Kolmogorov's $k^{-5/3}$ spectrum.
 Magnetic energy spectra are compensated \mm{for by} Kazantsev's $k^{3/2}$
 \fg{power law} \citep{Sch02,BS14}, and kinetic energy \mm{by}
 Kolmogorov's $k^{-5/3}$.
 %FAG: swapped order
 %The SSD magnetic spectrum (Figure~\ref{fig:tangling}b) experiences only a
 %slight shift of its peak to smaller wavenumber during its evolution.
 %The forcing scale $\kf$ is strongly reflected in kinetic energy and tangling 
 %magnetic energy, but does not affect the SSD magnetic spectra.
 The forcing scale $\kf$ is
 % mm strongly \fg{identified}
 \mm{prominent} in kinetic
 energy \fg{spectra for both models} and the magnetic energy \fg{spectra of
 the tangling}, but \mm{not}
 \fg{in the magnetic spectra of the SSD}.
 %FAG: revised
 %The SSD magnetic spectrum (Figure~\ref{fig:tangling}b) experiences only a
 %slight shift of its peak to smaller wavenumber during its evolution.
 \fg{For SSD the range with Kazantsev power law (horizontal) extends to scales
 smaller than the forcing scale (Figure~\ref{fig:tangling}\,b), and during the
 kinematic phase the magnetic energy peak is at $k/k_1\simeq9$.}
\fg{For tangling (Figure~\ref{fig:tangling}\,c) the Kazantsev

\section{\mm{Supernova-driven} turbulence model design} \label{sec:model}

 %In our SN-driven turbulence models, we exclude large-scale magnetic
 %field dynamics by neglecting rotation, shear, and stratification. Our
 %simulation domain is a periodic cube of length 256 pc and zone size
 %of $\delta x=0.5$, 1, 2 or 4$\pc$.
 %A random 1~nG seed field excludes tangling of an imposed field as the 
 %source of any magnetic amplification.
 %mm \fg{The design of these}
\mm{Our} SN-driven turbulence models exclude large-scale
 magnetic field dynamics by \fg{omitting global scale} rotation, shear, and
 stratification.
 Our simulation domain is a periodic cube of length 256 pc and zone size
 $\dx=0.5$, 1, 2 or 4$\pc$\fg{, except for \mm{our} direct comparisons with
 \BKM, \mm{ which have} domains \mm{of} 200 pc and $\dx=0.78$, 1.56 and 3.12$\pc$ (units henceforth
 assumed)}.
 \fg{When comparing \mm{to} \BKM\ a uniform background field $\sim10$~nG is imposed.
 Otherwise we apply only a} random 1~nG seed field \fg{to} exclude tangling of
 \fg{the} imposed field as the source of any magnetic amplification.

\subsection{\fg{Resolution and convergence}} \label{sec:conv}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%mm [2b shows this is not true] \fg{For all
  % mm $\dx$
  %\mm{resolutions}
  %considered we find that SSD in the
  %ISM appears to be easily excited.
\mm{Figure~\ref{fig:eb-res} shows magnetic energy as a function of
  time for models with $\eta = 10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$, as well as a
  direct comparison of our technique to \BKM.   We find that numerical
diffusion still dominates at these resolutions for the lower
resistivity, as can be seen from the increasing speed of the SSD with
resolution, but that a converged SSD solution emerges at the higher 
value for parsec resolution.}
%mm Figure~\ref{fig:eb-res}\,(a) for $\eta=10^{-4}$ and $\dot\sigma=0.2\SNr$
 % shows growth at all $\dx$, the growth rate increasing with resolution.
 % Higher numerical dissipation of the flow
 % %mm [no it is truncation error] applies due to shock and hyper
 % %diffusion at low
 %    \mm{occurs at lower}
 % resolution, which impedes the turbulence and efficiency of
 % the dynamo.
 Saturation at around 5\% of $\overline{e_K}$ appears to be a well-converged
 result.
%mm The growth rate does not yet quite converge between 1 and 0.5\,pc, but as we
% shall show, $\eta$ is not sufficiently acting beyond the numerical diffusion.}
%
% \fg{When we consider} $\eta=10^{-3}$ \fg{(Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-res}\,b), at which
% applicable resistivity is well determined by $\eta$, there is}
\mm{The $\eta = 10^{-3}$ models show}
 false convergence
 \citep{FMA91} of solutions with similar magnetic energy decay at $\dx\geq2$.
%mm However, higher resolution solutions converge to rapid magnetic
% amplification occurring between 40 and 60~Myr.
 \fg{We note that strong fluctuations in the characteristics of the
   flow
   % mm due to
   \mm{occur at the}
 low $\dot\sigma$ \mm{that we chose to avoid thermal runaway
   \citep{LOCBN15},} with thermal phases occupying changing fractional volumes
 \citep[e.g.][]{gatto2015} and hosting SSD instabilities with different 
 thresholds and growth rates.
 % mm There is convergence in the occurrence of sporadic slowing and acceleration
 % of the dynamo for $\dx\lesssim1$ and between $\eta=10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$,
 % occurring near $t=20$ and 40\,Myr.
 }
  
 \fg{We choose low $\dot\sigma$ to preserve the multiphase structure in the 
 closed numerical domain. 
 However, we also display in Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-res}\,(c) results of direct
 comparison with \BKM\ using $\dot\sigma=8\SNr$.
 The multiphase structure rapidly fades into a single phase domain of hot gas
 ($T>10^7$\,K).
 The growth rate is faster and very uniformly exponential, reflective of the
 single phase kinematics and more persistent forcing rate, yet saturating
 also at about 5\% of $\overline{e_K}$.
 Our growth is faster than \BKM\ equivalent rates, because the Pencil Code is a
 higher order less diffusive code.
 We include a lower resolution run to demonstrate consistency with \BKM.
 Our runs with $\dot\sigma=\SNr$, also grow more quickly than at $0.2\SNr$,
 while saturating at $5\%\overline{e_K}$}% (Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-nu}\,f,h).}

 \fg{We can also examine the properties of the flow and magnetic field through
 their energy spectra, some of which we display in Figure\,\ref{fig:3power}.
 From panels (a2), (b2) and (c2) with kinetic spectra for all $\dx$ and 
 $\eta=0$, $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$, respectively.
 Clearly there is excellent convergence in the flow for $\dx\leq1$ at all
 scales $k\lesssim 30\kpc^{-1}$.
 The addition of viscosity $\nu=10^{-3}$, indicated by the magenta curves in
 panels (b2) and (c2), does not materially alter the kinetic energy spectrum
 Interestingly, the higher dissipation in the flow at the grid scale 
 $\dx\geq2$ is also transferred along the whole spectrum, showing that
 the flow is losing energy even at the largest scales.
 The shape of the corresponding magnetic energy spectra are also consistent 
 for $\dx\leq1$, with variation in magnitude related to differences in
 numerical resistivity.
}
 
 \fg{We have shown that SSD turbulence has convergent results for $\dx\leq1$.
 Underresolving SN driven turbulence results in a significant loss of energy
 at all scales.
 SSD for $0.2\SNr\leq \dot\sigma \leq 8\SNr$ saturates in the ISM at about
 $5\%\overline{e_K}$ and grows more rapidly with increasing SN rates.

 %FAG: incorporated into new subsection on convergence of results

 %Figure~\ref{fig:eb-res}(a) shows improving convergence of dynamo growth rate
 %for $\eta=10^{-4}$ as resolution increases, although even at 0.5~pc resolution
 %full convergence does not appear to have been reached.
 %Saturation at around 5\% of $\overline{e_K}$ appears to be a well-converged
 %result.
 %At $\eta=10^{-3}$, there is false convergence \citep{FMA91} of solutions with
 %similar magnetic energy decay at $\dx=2$ and $4\pc$.
 %However, higher resolution solutions converge to rapid magnetic
 %amplification occurring between 40 and 60~Myr.
 % 
 % For $\dx\geq2\pc$ growth rates vary sporadically.
 % Growth is accelerated in Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-res}(a) and (b) near 20\,Myr,
 % 40\,Myr and again at 100\,Myr.
 % Other times show decay or lower growth rates, depending on $\dx$ or $\eta$.
 % The irregular SN forcing and varying fractional volume of different phases of
 % the ISM account for these alternating regimes, but we defer analysis of the
 % details to a future work.

\subsection{\fg{Effective resistivity and Prandtl number}} \label{sec:eta}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 \fg{To understand the role of physical parameters $\eta$ and $\nu$ on the
 SSD, we need to differentiate them from numerical diffusivities.}
 Figure~\ref{fig:eb-nu}\,(a1-a2) shows that profiles at $\eta=10^{-5}$ are
 indistinguishable from $\eta=0$, and so numerical resistivity still controls
 dynamics, even at $\delta x = 0.5$.
 At $\eta=10^{-4}$ the dynamo diverges from $\eta=0$, showing that physical
 resistivity is \fg{effective}, at least in part of the domain.
 At all $\dx$ in our study physical resistivity $\eta\geq10^{-3}$ is clearly
 well resolved \fg{as the effective
 resistivity (Figure~\ref{fig:eb-nu}\,a1-d2)}.
 %FAG: true but not a significant remark
 %Models with common $\dot\sigma$ have the same schedule and location of SN,
 %but the timestep at low resolution is larger, such that actual timing and
 %explosive environment can differ between models.
 %Increased statistical noise is therefore evident, particularly in panels (e)
 %and (f).

 %FAG: this has now been commented in previous subsection. We could add details
 %FAG: from here to that paragraph, but not sure it is necessary.
 %Growth rates are sporadic within models, but are consistent between models.
 %For example, between 8 and 15\,Myr the strength of growth (or decay) in 
 %Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-nu}(a, b) reduces as $\eta$ increases.
 %Accelerated growth near 19\,Myr for $\eta=10^{-3}$ coincides with even higher
 %acceleration for $\eta\le10^{-4}$, consistent with theory.
 %The low $\eta$ models at $0.5\pc$ saturate already by 20\,Myr, but for $1\pc$
 %there is another epoch of lower growth rate up to 40\,Myr and then a
 %subsequent acceleration resulting in saturation for all models within
 %60\,Myr, including for $\eta=10^{-3}$.

 %In Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-nu}(c, d) at low resolution with $\dot\sigma=0.2\SNr$
 %profiles for $\eta=10^{-4}$ are not distinct from $\eta=0$, and there is no
 %dynamo at all for $\dx=4\pc$ with well resolved $\eta=10^{-3}$.
 %At 100\,Myr there is a period of accelerated dynamo at $\dx=2\pc$, but 
 %for $\eta=10^{-3}$ this is not sustained and subsequently diffuses away.
 \fg{When we consider $e_B$ for the models applying only numerical
 viscosity,
 Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-nu}\,(a, c, d), $\eta\geq10^{-3}$ initially appears
 sufficient to suppress SSD.
 At low resolution this remains so for $\dot\sigma=0.2\SNr$ (panels c1 and d1),
 apart from a transitory surge near 100\,Myr for $\dx=2$.
 However, for $\dot\sigma=\SNr$ within 100\,Myr SSD is evident.
 Only, $\eta=0.005$ dampens SSD (panel d2).}
 The mean sonic Mach number $\overline\Ms=0.8$ for $\dot\sigma=\SNr$, compared
 to $0.5$ for $0.2\SNr$.
 A higher $\Ms$ has been demonstrated to impede an SSD in isothermal turbulence
 \citep{Haugen:2004M}, which is contradicted here.

 \fg{To resolve this contradiction, let us consider the 
 kinetic energy spectra in Figure\,\ref{fig:3power}.}
 %FAG: moved here from below
 The kinetic energy spectra display a bottleneck effect
 \citep{Falkovich94,HBD03}, an energy cascade less efficient than $k^{-5/3}$
 leading to an accumulation of power and then rapid dissipation at high $k$.
 This bottleneck shifts to lower $k$ as $\dx$ increases.
 \fg{Comparing the spectra in Figure\,\ref{fig:3power}\,(d2), we
 see that the bottleneck peaks at lower scales, $k/k_1\simeq6,\,10$ and 12 for
 $\dot\sigma=0.2,\,1$ and $8\SNr$, respectively.
 The deeper into the magnetic energy spectrum this peak extends the more 
 scales available for energy transfer to the magnetic field and the more
 efficient the SSD driving.
 The critical resistivity above which SSD is suppressed, therefore, 
 increases with $\dot\sigma$, within the range considered. 
 Even at $\dot\sigma=0.2$, after 20 -- 40\,Myr for $\dx\leq1$ SSD occurs for
 $\eta=10^{-3}$.
}

 %FAG: incorporated Ma into new para above
 %At $\dot\sigma=\SNr$ (Fig.\,\ref{fig:eb-nu}e, f) the higher forcing rate is
 %sufficient to produce SSD at $\eta\geq10^{-3}$, but not $\eta=5\cdot10^{-3}$.
 %The mean sonic Mach number $\overline\Ms=0.8$ for $\dot\sigma=\SNr$, compared
 %to $0.5$ for $0.2\SNr$.
 %A higher $\Ms$ has been demonstrated to impede an SSD in isothermal turbulence
 %\citep{Haugen:2004M}, which is contradicted here.
 %With the level of statistical noise we cannot affirm $\eta\leq10^{-4}$ exceeds
 %numerical resistivity in this model. 
 %However, $\eta\gtrsim5\cdot10^{-4}$ is resolved at $\dx=2$ (magenta, solid)
 %and at $\dx=4\pc$ the resolved limit is $2\cdot10^{-4}<\eta\lesssim10^{-3}$
 %(purple, solid and cyan, dotted lines).
 %For $\dx=2\pc$, (e), we see two phases of accelerated SSD at 90 and 110\,Myr,
 %which are not present for $\dx=4\pc$, (f).

\end{figure}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 \fg{Resistivity contributes to Rm, which is expected to control the onset
 of the SSD and affect growth rate.
 We therefore anticipate that lower $\eta$ would correlate with higher growth
 rate \citep{Sch07}.
 This mainly is the case when we compare models with $\dx\leq1$ at 
 concurrent stages in their evolution.
 However, in Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-nu}\,(c2) there are some anomolous patterns, 
 where higher $\eta$ models overtake lower $\eta$ models, e.g., at 80\,Myr.
 To explore this further we include experiments with $\dx=1$ and $\nu>0$, and
 examine the effect of Pm on the SSD (Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-nu}\,b1, b2).
 We identify each model by $\Pm=\nu/\eta$, but due to the inclusion of 
 shock and hyper diffusivities, the effective Pm and, indeed, Rm vary 
 substantially across space and time.}

 \fg{Plotted in panel b2, where we fix $\eta=10^{-4}$ and vary $\nu$,
 initial growth of $e_B$ is faster for 
 $\Pm=0.1$ than for high Pm.}
 This is a regime less conducive to exciting the SSD than the high $\Pm$ regime
 typical of the ISM \citep{HBD04}.
 \fg{A plausible explanation may be that the higher fluid Reynolds number, Re,
 could facilitate dynamo.
 We therefore fix $\nu=10^{-3}$ and vary $\eta$. 
 Plotted in panel b1 the growth rates mainly
 conform to our expectations, except for $\Pm=5$ between 20 and 40\,Myr.
 We confirm that $\eta\geq10^{-2.3}$ suppresses SSD at $\dot\sigma=0.2\SNr$.
 While the saturation level is insensitive to Pm, with $\nu$ fixed (panel
 b2), the saturation level increases with Pm for $\eta$ fixed (panel b1),
 indicating saturation level is sensitive to Re.
 We also include two of these plots in panel a2 for comparison to $\nu=0$.
 Comparing the kinetic energy spectra (magenta) models in 
 Figure\,\ref{fig:3power}\,(b2, c2), $\nu$ alters very little.}
 
 \fg{We have shown that the critical resistivity for SSD in the ISM with a
 low SN rate is $10^{-2.3}>\eta_{\rm crit}>10^{-3}$ and
 that this increases with increasing
 $\dot\sigma$ within the range considered.
 Although higher Rm and Pm increase growth rate and ease of SSD in
 line with theoretical expectations, some anomolies in SSD pattern
 do not simply relate to Pm or Rm.
 The growth rates can vary considerably over time, which we believe to be a 
 response to variation in the multiphase ISM.

\subsection{\fg{Tangling of the imposed field}} \label{sec:Balsara}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 SN-driven turbulence does not have a well-defined forcing scale, unlike the
 simplified model in Section\,\ref{sec:ssd-tang}, because of the
 heterogeneous ISM structure and random explosions.
 The forcing scale will be distributed at scales greater than about $60\pc$
 \citep[][Table\,3]{HSSFG17}, or $k\lesssim17$~kpc$^{-1}$. 
 Figure\,\ref{fig:4power}\,(a) shows the evolving compensated spectra for 
 $\dx=0.5$ between \fg{12} and 32\,Myr\fg{, and (b) for a comparison model
 with \BKM\ at $\dx=0.78$ between 4 and 21\,Myr.}
 %FAG: wording
 %We compare spectra for $\eta=10^{-4}$, (a), spanning the period of
 %dynamo growth and saturation, and for $\eta=10^{-3}$, (b) during
 %the period that the field
 %persists near seed strength.
 \fg{The period spans two epochs of SSD with distinct rates of growth 
 followed by saturation in panels (a).
 Note, that the magnitude of the kinetic energy spectra fluctuate up and down
 during SSD, varying by 2 orders of magnitude at the lower $\dot\sigma$ (a2),
 but only 1 order of magnitude (b2) and 1 -- 2 orders of magnitude higher
 on average.} 
 The Kolmogorov range extends at all times to $k>20\kpc^{-1}$ and mostly 
 to $k>40\kpc^{-1}$ (a2) or $k>30\kpc^{-1}$ (b). 

 The compensated magnetic energy spectra in Figure\,\ref{fig:4power}\,(a1, b1)
 have \fg{peaks conforming to the end of the Kazantsev range.
 For $\eta=10^{-4}$ up to 14\,Myr this peak is at $k<6\kpc^{-1}$ while the
 SSD grows modestly.
 During accelerated growth the Kazentsev range extends to}
 $k\gtrsim 20\kpc^{-1}$, above the forcing scale and consistent with SSD
 (Figure\,\ref{fig:tangling}\,b).
 The peak contracts upon saturation to $k<10\kpc^{-1}$, consistent with no
 dynamo (Figure\,\ref{fig:tangling}\,c).
 In Figure\,\ref{fig:4power}\,(b1) \fg{up to 7\,Myr there is no Kazantsev range
 and the peak energy increases as $k\rightarrow0$, a signature of tangling of
 the imposed field, similar to Figure\,\ref{fig:tangling}\,(c) (see also
 magenta curve Figure\,\ref{fig:3power}\,d1).
 %FAG: already covered implicitly by earlier discussion
 %The Kazantsev range does not extend to as high $k$ as the Kolmogorov range,
 %a consequence of the low Pm in these SN-driven models. 
 %In the high Pm ISM, where transfer from kinetic energy can occur at every
 %wavenumber in the Kolmogorov spectrum, an SSD is even easier to excite.
 However, as the magnetic field grows much larger than the imposed field,
 this signature disappears and the peak shifts to high $k$.}
 
 \fg{We have demonstrated that the magnetic field amplification in \BKM\ is
 due to SSD. 
 Tangling of the imposed field is present, but is limited to within an
 order of magnitude.
 The amplification is dominated by SSD and our other models 
 confirm an imposed field is not required.
 }
 %FAG: obsolete
 %Figure\,\ref{fig:3power}(a) -- (f) shows spectra at $t=19.5$ Myr when an SSD is
 %active for the higher resolution models, and at $t=100$ Myr for the lower
 %resolution models, which shows SSD for the $\dx= 2\pc$ model, but not for the
 %$4\pc$ model. (Hydrodynamic parameters are fixed at each resolution.)
 %The kinetic energy spectrum is convergent for $\dx=0.5\pc$ and $\dx=1\pc$,
 %except for a viscous cutoff at lower $k$ for $\dx=1$.
 %The kinetic energy at all $k$ is reduced for lower resolution, not just at
 %the viscous dissipation scale, but even at the largest scales.
 %To fully resolve the kinetic energy for scales larger than $k=24\kpc^{-1}$,
 %that is $\ell\gtrsim40\pc$, therefore requires $\dx\lesssim1\pc$.
 
 %FAG: merged with earlier paragraph
 %The kinetic energy spectra display a bottleneck effect
 %\citep{Falkovich94,HBD03}, an energy cascade less efficient than $k^{-5/3}$
 %leading to an accumulation of power and then rapid dissipation at high $k$.
 %This bottleneck shifts to lower $k$ as $\dx$ increases, but always at higher
 %$k$ than the Kazantsev range in the corresponding magnetic spectrum, due to
 %the low Pm.

 %Perhaps surprisingly, there is little difference in the kinetic energy
 %spectrum, Figure\,\ref{fig:3power}(h), between simulations with
 %$\dot\sigma=0.2\SNr$ and $\SNr$, despite five times as much energy being
 %applied to the forcing in the latter case.
 %For $\eta=10^{-3}$ there is more energy near the bottleneck in the high
 %$\dot\sigma$ case (cyan dotted line), so more energy can be tranferred to
 %the SSD at the smallest scales.
 %The comparison is obscured for $\eta=10^{-4}$, because the high $\dot\sigma$
 %magnetic field is already 3 or 4 orders of magnitude stronger, acquiring some
 %of the kinetic energy (red dash-dotted line).

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}

 \fg{Through the most extensive resolution and parameter study to date, we
 demonstrate in this letter that SSD is likely very easily excited in
 the ISM.
 The critical resistivity is $0.005>\eta_{\rm crit}\gtrsim0.001\kpc\kms$ for 
 supernova rate $\dot \sigma=0.2\SNr$ and increasing over the 
 range considered $\dot \sigma\in(0.2\SNr,8\SNr)$.
 SSD in the ISM saturates at about 5\% of the equipartion kinetic energy
 density.
 This level is insensitive to Pm, but is higher with increasing Re.}
 We find that the conventional approach from dynamo theory of categorising the 
 turbulence according to Rm based on a forcing scale $\ell$, mean random
 velocity $u_{\rm rms}$ and resistivity $\eta$ is inadequate for such a
 complicated system.

 We show that simulations with insufficient resolution can appear to
 converge to a false solution lacking dynamo activity
 (Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-res}\,b). This can occur because these simulations are not
 scale independent. 
 The SN energy input and the physically motivated ISM cooling processes impose
 length and time scales that must be adequately resolved.
 \fg{We obtain convergent results for SSD with grid resolution
 $\dx\lesssim1\pc$.}

 \fg{We confirm, with and without the use of an imposed magnetic field, that
 the field amplification obtained in SN-driven ISM turbulence by \citet{BKMM04}
 was evidence of an SSD and not only due to tangling of their imposed field.}
 %FAG: trim
 %Our models with $\dx=0.5$ and $1\pc$ with $\eta=10^{-3}\kpc\kms$ show that a
 A seed field of less than 1~nG can be amplified to saturation at microgauss
 levels within about 10\,Myr (Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-res}). 
 Unlike isothermal turbulence high Mach numbers do not necessarily impede SSD
 in the ISM with increasing SN forcing.


 %In this Letter we demonstrate, without the use of an imposed magnetic field,
 %that the field amplification demonstrated by \citet{BKMM04} was evidence of
 %an SSD in SN-driven ISM turbulence and not just caused by tangling of their
 %imposed field.
 %Through the most extensive resolution and parameter study to date, we show
 %that SN-driven turbulence easily excites an SSD even at SN rates well below the
 %Galactic value.
 %Our conclusion is supported by noting that the resistivity of the ISM is far
 %smaller than we can resolve numerically, so the ISM is far more susceptible to
 %dynamo action than our models.
 %Our models with $\dx=0.5$ and $1\pc$ with $\eta=10^{-3}\kpc\kms$ show that a
 %seed field of less than 1~nG can be amplified to saturation at microgauss
 %levels within about 10\,Myr (Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-res}). 
 %Unlike isothermal turbulence high Mach numbers do not necessarily impede SSD
 %in the ISM with increasing SN forcing.

 %We further show that simulations with insufficient resolution can appear to
 %converge to a false solution lacking dynamo activity
 %(Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-res}b). This can occur because these simulations are not
 %scale independent. 
 %The SN energy input and the physically motivated ISM cooling processes impose
 %length and time scales that must be adequately resolved.
 %To reach true convergence requires resolution of $1\pc$ or better.
 %In our models, resolutions $\dx\geq2\pc$ not only give an incorrect dynamo
 %solution, but also exhibit significant kinetic energy losses due to excess
 %dissipation.
 %This also affects the energy spectrum at the largest scales, so should be 
 %considered when interpreting results using adaptive mesh refinement.
 %We do, however find the well-converged result at all resolutions that when an
 %SSD is excited it saturates at about 5\% of the energy equipartition level.
 %At low resolution this is a lower bound, because the time-averaged kinetic
 %energy density is understated, due to dissipative losses.
 %This might account for the discrepancy between the energy density of the mean
 %magnetic field and the random magnetic field in \citet{Gent:2013b}, due to the
 %LSD being well resolved while the SSD remained underresolved.

 %We find that the conventional approach from dynamo theory of categorising the 
 %turbulence according to Rm based on a forcing scale $\ell$, mean random velocity
 %$u_{\rm rms}$ and resistivity $\eta$ is inadequate for such a complicated
 %system.
 %We will show in upcoming work that the ISM appears to have multiple regimes
 %with thermal phases occupying changing fractional volumes
 %\citep[e.g.][]{gatto2015} and hosting SSD instabilities with different
 %thresholds and growth rates.
 %Explaining the interaction of these SSDs will require more sophisticated
 %statistical and perhaps toplogical techniques, in advance of being able to 
 %address how such an SSD interacts with an LSD.

 %FAG: trim
 %With grid resolution $\dx\geq2\pc$, an SSD in SN-driven turbulence simulations
 %can be excluded with $\eta\gtrsim10^{-3}\kpc\kms$.
 %In \citet{Gressel:2008} and \citet{GE20}, $\dx$ is 8.3 and $6.7\pc$,
 %respectively and $\eta\simeq6.5\cdot10^{-3}\kpc\kms$, which appears to exclude
 %an SSD.
 %\citet{Gent:2013b} applied $\eta\simeq8\cdot10^{-4}\kpc\kms$ with $\dx=4\pc$,
 %which would support SSD with SN rates similar to the solar neighbourhood.
 %The latter obtain an LSD with galactic angular momentum $\Omega=\OSN$, where
 %$\OSN=25\kms\kpc^{-1}$ is the rate in the solar neighbourhood.
 %The former require $\Omega\geq4\OSN$ to excite an LSD.
 %The value of Rm at the largest scales would be 7.5 times higher for the latter
 %model, which alone can explain the LSD at lower $\Omega$.
 %Early efforts by \citet{Korpi:1999b} were unable to detect even LSD.
 %With a resolution even less than \citet{Gressel:2008} $\Omega\gg\OSN$ would
 %be required to excite LSD, and SSD would be ruled out.
 \citet{Gressel:2008} and \citet{GE20} have $\dx=8.3$ and $6.7\pc$,
 respectively, and $\eta\simeq10^{-2.2}\kpc\kms$, which appears to exclude
 an SSD.
 \citet{Gent:2013a} with $\dx=4\pc$ applied $\eta\simeq10^{-3.1}\kpc\kms$,
 which would support SSD for $\dot\sigma\simeq\SNr$.
 The latter obtain an LSD with galactic angular momentum $\Omega=\OSN$, where
 $\OSN=25\kms\kpc^{-1}$ is the rate in the solar neighbourhood.
 The former require $\Omega\gtrsim4\OSN$ to excite an LSD.
 Early efforts by \citet{Korpi:1999b} were unable to detect even LSD.
 \fg{We can now construct LSD experiments to explore how SSD impacts the 
 onset of LSD, critical $\Omega$, and dependence on $\dot\sigma$ for LSD.}

%FAG saved from end of section 3 
 %A commonly used expression for Rm is 
 %\begin{equation}\label{eq:sRm}
 %\Rm=\frac{\ell {u_{\rm rms}}}{\eta},
 %\end{equation}
 %where $\ell = 2 \pi/\kf$ is the forcing scale.
 %However, the inhomogeneity of the turbulence and changing multiphase
 %composition of the ISM render defining a single forcing scale or rms velocity
 %unreliable.
 %We, therefore, consider computing Rm at each grid point directly from the
 %ratio of advective to diffusive terms in the induction equation
 %%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 %\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:Rm}
 %  \Rm = \frac{\left|\vect{u}\times\vect{B}\right|}{
 %    \left|\eta\vect\nabla^2\vect{A}+\eta_3\vect\nabla^6\vect{A}\right|}.
 %\end{eqnarray}
 %%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 %Using averaged values (eq.~[\ref{eq:sRm}]), 
 %$\Rm = 1.5 \cdot 10^4$, for $\eta=10^{-4}$, $\ell=50\pc$ and
 %${u_{\rm rms}}=30\kms$.
 %With the local definition (eq.~[\ref{eq:Rm}]) in the model with 
 %$\dx=0.5\pc$ and $\eta=10^{-4}$ at 20\,Myr we find
 %$\Rm\in(1.0\cdot10^{-4},5.8\cdot 10^3)$,
 %and mean value $\langle\Rm\rangle=4.1\pm5.7$.
 %Thus, the mean Rm appears unhelpful:
 %in the ISM some phases and regions may exceed the critical Rm for an
 %SSD while others do not.
 %Microscopic resistivity is temperature dependent \citep{CSR50}.
 %Even considering only turbulent resistivity to have relevance, 
 %typical length scales and rms velocities differ between phases.
 %Therefore, we use the explicitly chosen resistivity $\eta$ to discriminate
 %between models rather than Rm.

 %We have set $\nu=0$ and $\nu_3=\eta_3$ sufficient to numerically resolve the
 %grid scale.
 %The magnetic Prandtl number $\Pm = \Rm/\Rey$, and like $\Rm$ we have
 %$\Pm\in(4.2\cdot10^{-6},4.8\cdot10^{4})$, due to inclusion of shock capturing
 %viscosity and differences in definition of hyperviscosity and hyperresistivity.
 %Hence, some part of each simulation will be characterised by high Pm,
 %but $\langle\Pm\rangle<1$.
 %%FAG: merged this with section 4.2
 %This is a regime less conducive to exciting the SSD than the high $\Pm$ regime
 %typical of the ISM \citep{HBD04}.
 %In separate experiments with $\nu>\eta$ (high Pm), which we shall describe in
 %future work, we do in fact see increased growth rates for lower $\eta$, as
 %expected \citep{Sch07}.

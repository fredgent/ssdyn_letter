\begin{abstract}
Magnetic fields appear to grow quickly even at early cosmological
times, suggesting the action of a small-scale dynamo (SSD) in the
interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. Previous studies have focused
on idealized turbulent driving of the SSD. We here simulate more
realistic supernova-driven turbulence to determine whether it can
drive an SSD.  We vary the physical resistivity (and thus the magnetic
Reynolds number), as well as the numerical resolution and supernova
rate to delineate the regime in which an SSD occurs.
We find convergence in the growth rate of the SSD with resolution approaching 
sub-parsec scale for a given supernova explosion frequency
$\dot\sigma$. Across the modelled range of 0.5 to 4 parsec resolution we find that with
sufficiently low resistivity the SSD saturates consistently at about 5\% of
the energy equipartion level, independent of the growth rate. Dynamo
growth rates for $\dot\sigma=\SNr$, the solar neighbourhood rate, relative to models with
$\dot\sigma=0.2\SNr$, are greater despite higher Mach numbers.
This is despite the negative impact on SSD expected from the highly compressible

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
%==============================================================================
%\fag{Perhaps here, first a paragraph addressing the importance of MF in the ISM
%at all}

%MJK The landscape to me seems to be the following:
%MJK GE20 do not explicitely state that they do not have SSD, but do go forward with QKTFM, which assumes that no magnetic background turbulence is present, hence they make an implicit claim of having no SSD.
%MJK Balsara04 clearly had an SSD, as LSD was not allowed for, but had an imposed
%MJK field, and the role of that is unclear.
%MJK Fred+gang claim LSD and SSD, but it is unclear whether this is true, as
%MJK separating SSD and LSD is difficult.
%MJK Steinwandel et al. have recently claimed that an SSD is present in a
%MJK galactic-scale simulation, but no LSD, and that SSD "dies" off at later
%MJK stages, when Kazantsev scaling is not observed.
%MJK So, our study now tries to address at which resolution a fully healthy
%MJK SSD can be expected in a full ISM simulation, and helps to interpret
%MJK the mess descripbed above.
%MJK Now we DO not have imposed field, and can confirm the conclusions of Balsara04
%MJK without it.
%MJK It would be interesting if a critical Rm could be nailed down, but I doubt we
%MJK can, and must resort to what is listed above.

%FAG 28.9 reword

%FAG: rewording more concisely
%This letter addresses the necessary conditions for and nature of a small-scale
%dynamo (SSD) in the interstellar medium (ISM).
 This letter addresses the necessary conditions and properties of small-scale
 dynamo (SSD) in the interstellar medium (ISM).
%The SSD consists of dynamo modes acting at small eddy scales of the
%turbulence, so it drives magnetic field growth at the corresponding short
 SSD acts at small eddy scales of the turbulence, thus driving magnetic field
 growth correspondingly short turnover times.
There are large scales of separation between the fastest growing SSD
%instabilities and the large-scale dynamo (LSD) modes generating the magnetic
%field structures organised at the systemic scales of the galactic disk, spiral
%arms, or similar.
%As such, simulations capable of capturing the LSD alongside the faster
%growing modes of SSD are computationally challenging.
%However, it is likely that the interaction of SSD modes with the LSD
%fundamentally alter the evolution and structure of the magnetic field.
 instabilities and the large-scale dynamo (LSD) generating magnetic
 field structures organised on systemic scales, such as the galactic disk or
 spiral arms.
 Hence, simulations capable of capturing LSD alongside the faster growing modes
 of SSD are computationally challenging.
 However, the interaction of SSD modes with the LSD likely fundamentally alters
 the evolution and structure of the magnetic field.

%FAG: rewording more concisely
%In many simulations of supernova (SN) driven turbulence with realistic vertical 
%stratification \citep[e.g.,][]{deAvillez:2005,PO07,Hill:2012a,HI14} the
%mechanisms for inducing large-scale magnetic fields, such as rotation and shear,
%are absent.
 Many simulations of supernova- (SN-)driven turbulence with realistic vertical
 stratification \citep[e.g.,][]{deAvillez:2005,PO07,Hill:2012a,HI14} have no
 mechanisms for inducing LSD, such as rotation and shear.
%To examine the effect of strong ordered magnetic fields these models then rely
%on imposition of a background or initial magnetic field, typically uniform,
%which is then perturbed by SN explosions.
 The effect of strong ordered magnetic fields is modelled by imposition of a
 background, typically uniform, magnetic field.
 If an imposed field is sufficiently close to equipartition its characteristics
 would dominate any MHD results.
 Any amplification of the field will add only to the turbulent structure
 due to tangling of the imposed field or SSD, if it is present. 
%The amplification of the magnetic field in these cases may include an SSD in
%case of sufficiently high magnetic Reynolds numbers, Rm, but any amplification
%of the large-scale field is limited to linear growth through tangling of the
%imposed field.
%The fluctuations can then undergo either linear or exponential growth
%depending on the absence or presence of an SSD.
%Any initial large-scale field would diffuse leaving only the random field. 
%If an imposed field is sufficiently close to equipartition its characteristics
%would dominate any MHD results.
%FAG: moving to para 4
%On the other hand, the magnetic noise produced by tangling
%will grow exponentially if the system supports the LSD instability.
%Such a noise plays an important role in quenching the LSD by contributing
%to the magnetic $\alpha$-effect $\alpha_M$, which leads to the saturation
%of large-scale fields in the nonlinear regime.
%MJK Is this paragraph now too complicated? Should we only try to highlight the aspects relevant here? I am not sure how much text we can have here in the first place...
%FAG OK

%FAG: rewording more concisely
%While the SN experiments considered in this letter are restricted to SSD, some
%large-scale models do seek to include the LSD
%\citep[e.g.,][]{Korpi:1999b,Gressel:2008,HWK09,WA09,Gent:2013b,EGSFB16,Pakmor17,SBADMN19,SDLMBP20,GE20}.
%%FAG: -> SSD a->an I read ess ess dee and I think this is the correct way to handle acronyms
%%Most of these do not include a small-scale dynamo.
%Most of these do not include an SSD.
%\citet{Gent:2013b,EGSFB16} do appear to include SSD, but without a clear
%understanding of the characteristics of this SSD it is difficult to explore the
%effect this has on the LSD and the properties of the ISM.
 Some large-scale models do seek to include LSD \citep[e.g.,][]{Korpi:1999b,
 Gressel:2008,HWK09,WA09,Pakmor17,SBADMN19,GE20}.
 Most have no SSD.
 \citet{SBADMN19} find SSD, but no LSD.
 \citet{Gent:2013b,EGSFB16} appear to include SSD, but without clear
 understanding of the SSD properties how can this be confirmed and its
 effect on the LSD?
%\citet{SBADMN19,SDLMBP20} also claim that SSD is present in a galactic-scale
%simulation, but do not excite LSD. 
%At late stage the SSD ceases, as shown by
%the disappearance of Kazantsev scaling in the magnetic power spectra.
%FAG: moved from para 2 and rephrased
 The magnetic noise produced by tangling will also grow exponentially due to
 the LSD.
 This noise plays an important role in quenching the LSD due to the magnetic
 $\alpha$-effect, causing saturation of large-scale fields.
 We need to discriminate these effects.

%FAG: reorder para 3 -> 4
%MJK The previous para was about neglecting the LS effects, and this paragraph continues on the same topic. Is this really intended? I guess we could get a rid of this simply. I understand models referred to above have vertical stratification and those below not, but cannot we simply group them together? Btw, stratification alone and even boundary conditions that are inhomogeneous in the vertical, can of course drive some sort of a dynamo effect, but definitely not of the type we believe to take place in the galaxies. Does anybody see a way how to reconcile this?
%FAG: merging next two paras for clarity and to be concise
%More commonly, models of the SN-driven dynamo in the ISM have ignored the 
%large-scale effects and examined the SSD or the effect of the
%turbulent magnetic field on the properties of the ISM
%\citep[e.g.,][]{BKMM04,BalKim05,MacLow:2005}.
%A seed or imposed field for such models could be uniform or random, but if the
%simulated field were the result of tangling rather than dynamo, then any
%conclusions about the ISM would depend on the veracity of the chosen field
%rather than the nature of the MHD turbulence.
%
%Given the uncertainty over the presence of SSD in the large-scale simulations
%we seek to confirm how to identify, quantify and characterise SSD, so that we
%can adequately interpret its action in simulations of LSD.
%\citet{BKMM04} report SSD in ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), but with only
%numerical diffusion and a limited set of resolution and parameters it was not
%possible for them to demonstrate convergence of the solutions nor dependence on
%Rm or magnetic Prandtl number, Pm.
%They include a weak imposed uniform field; we shall show that it is possible
%to demonstrate conclusively that the amplification of their field is a result of
%dynamo action and not just tangling of the field.

 how do we identify, quantify and characterise the SSD, so we can adequately

\section{Disentangling the dynamo} \label{sec:ssd-tang}
%==============================================================================

%To illustrate some differences between tangling and SSD we adopt a simplified
%model with non-helical random forcing with wavenumber $\kf/k_1=8$ applied to
%isothermal uniform density in $256^3$, $2\pi$-periodic boxes with $k_1=1$ being
%the lowest wavenumber in the domain.
%A uniform field with energy density $e_B\simeq6\cdot10^{-22}\overline{e_K}$ is
%imposed, where $\overline{e_K}$ is the time-averaged kinetic energy density.
%The two simulations are distinguished only by use of dimensionless
%$\eta=10^{-4}$, exciting an SSD, and $\eta=2\cdot10^{-3}$
%subcritical for dynamo.
%These yield Rm=148.0 with Pm=50.0 for the SSD and Rm=7.4 with Pm=2.5 where
%the dynamo is suppressed and amplification is limited to tangling of the
%imposed magnetic field.

 To illustrate differences between tangling and SSD we adopt a simplified
 model.
 Non-helical random forcing is applied at wavenumber $\kf/k_1=8$ to
 $256^3$, $2\pi$-periodic isothermal boxes.
 $k_1=1$ is the lowest wavenumber in the domain.
 The imposed uniform field has $e_B\simeq6\cdot10^{-22}\overline{e_K}$, where
 $\overline{e_K}$ is time-averaged kinetic energy density.
 Two simulations are distinguished by use of dimensionless $\eta=10^{-4}$
 and $\eta=2\cdot10^{-3}$.
 These yield Rm=148.0 with Pm=50.0, exciting SSD, and Rm=7.4 with Pm=2.5,

%FAG: moved to intro
%Our numerical implementations use the {\sc Pencil Code}\footnote{
%\href{https://github.com/pencil-code}{https://github.com/pencil-code}}.

%We plot some of the diagnostics from the results of these two simulations in 
%Figure\,\ref{fig:tangling}.
%Panel (a) illustrates that the SSD is characterised by
%exponential growth just over 400 eddy turnover times; see \cite{ZRS83} for the
%properties and excitation conditions of SSD.
%Tangling results only in linear amplification early on (see inset), saturating
%within 100 eddy turnover times at below 5 times the imposed field energy
%density.
%FAG: streamlining
 In Figure\,\ref{fig:tangling}(a) the SSD grows exponentially in just over 400
 eddy turnover times; see \cite{ZRS83} for SSD properties and excitation
 conditions.
 Tangling induces only linear growth (see inset), saturating just above
 the imposed field energy within 50 turnover times.

%The forcing scale has negligible effect on the magnetic spectra.
%However, for the tangling case (c) the peak wavenumber for the magnetic energy

%forcing scale for SSD, while confined to larger scales for the field with
%tangling only.
%FAG: streamlining
 Power spectra for the magnetic energy for the SSD as it evolves are plotted
 in Figure\,\ref{fig:tangling}(b) alongside a kinetic energy spectrum late on
 and similar for tangling in (c).
 $k$ is normalised by $k_1=L/(2\pi)$, where $L$ is the simulations's largest
 length scale and the largest wavenumber $k/k_1=128$.
 Magnetic energy spectra multiply $k^{-3/2}$ and kinetic $k^{5/3}$.
 The horizontal, therefore, corresponds to Kazantsev's $3/2$ scaling
 \citep{Sch02,BS14} or the Kolomogorov turbulent energy spectrum.
 The vertical dotted line indicates $\kf/k_1$.
 The SSD magnetic spectrum (b) evolves near self-similarly, the wavenumber for
 its peak above 20 early on, reducing to below 20 at saturation.
 $\kf$ is strongly identified with the peak in kientic energy and for 
 magnetic energy with tangling, but has negligible effect on magnetic
 spectra for SSD.
 The Kazantsev range of extends to wavenumbers larger than $\kf$ for SSD, while
 confined to scales larger than $\kf$ with tangling.
%FAG: moved from next para
 Thus, in dynamo kinetic energy along the Kolmogorov range transfers energy to
 the magnetic field at these scales inducing an inverse Kazantsev range
 at scales below $\kf$, while tangling transfers energy only at scales between
 $\kf$ and scale of the imposed field.
 At scales smaller than the Kazantsev range there is only dissipation. 
 

%Given the high magnetic Prandtl numbers, the magnetic spectra retain more energy
%at smaller scales than the kinetic spectra.
%Although the kinetic parameters are identical and are subject to the same 
%viscous cutoff, the SSD extends the kinetic energy into the 
%smaller scales
%due to the feedback from the Lorentz force.
%%With SSD there is a short inertial range for $10\leq k/k_1\lesssim 15$.
%%MJK Is there not also for the tangling case?
%%FAG: I say not add clarification
%With SSD there is a short inertial range in the kinetic spectrun 
%for $10\leq k/k_1\lesssim 15$, whereas in the tangling model the spectrum is
%decaying already at $k/k_1\gtrsim10$.
%%MJK Why in Fig 1 the y-scales are so much different when eb/ek is close to one?
%%FAG the spectra are integral quantities and all the kinetic energy is concentrated around k=8, which biases the peak value for eK and also there are the k-power prefactors
%Thus, in the dynamo kinetic energy deposited along the Kolmogorov range to
%smaller scales transfers energy to the magnetic field at these scales
%inducing an inverse Kazantsev range beginning at scales below the forcing
%scale, while with tangling the energy transfers to the magnetic field
%only at scales between the forcing scale and scale of the imposed field.
%There is only dissipation of the field at scales smaller than the Kazantsev 
%range.

%FAG: added overline for consistency and added eq number as NS suggested
 A commonly used expression for Rm is 
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:sRm}
 \Rm=\frac{\ell \overline{u_{\rm rms}}}{\eta},
 \end{equation}
 where $\ell$ is the forcing scale.
 However, the inhomogeneity of the turbulence and changing multiphase
 composition of the ISM render unreliable defining a single forcing scale from
 SN explosions or common rms velocity.
 We, therefore, consider compute Rm at each grid point directly from the
 equation,
 %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 \begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:Rm}
   \Rm = \frac{\left|\vect{u}\times\vect{B}\right|}{
     \left|\eta\vect\nabla^2\vect{A}+\eta_3\vect\nabla^6\vect{A}\right|}.
 \end{eqnarray}
 %-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hence, for $\dx=0.5\pc$ and $\eta=10^{-4}$ at 20\,Myr we obtain 
 $\langle\Rm\rangle=4.1\pm5.7$.
 Using equation\,\eqref{eq:sRm} 
 $\Rm = 15000$, for $\eta=10^{-4}$, $\ell=50\pc$ and
 $\overline{u_{\rm rms}}=30\kms$.
 With equation\,\eqref{eq:Rm} $\Rm\in(\ll1,>15000)$0.
 The mean Rm appears unhelpful and the concept of a critical Rm for SSD may
 differ between phases and regions.
 In the real ISM such Rm variation will be present.
 Microscopic resistivity appears temperature dependent \citep{CSR50}.
 Even considering only turbulent resistivity to have relevance, 
 typical length scales and rms velocities differ between phases.
 This challenge is for future work, but here we shall use explicit input $\eta$
 to discriminate between models.


 We have set $\nu=0$ and $\nu_3=\eta_3$ sufficient to numerically resolve the
 grid scale.
 $\Pm = \Rm/\Rey$, and like Rm we have $Pm\in(\ll1,\gg1)$, due
 to inclusion of shock capturing viscosity and differences in
 definition of hyper viscosity and hyper resistivity.
 Hence, some part of each simulation will be characterised by high Pm,
 however $\langle\Pm\rangle<1$.
 This is an even more difficult regime in which to excite SSD than high $\Pm$
 typical of the ISM \citep{HBD04}.
 In separate experiments with $\nu>\eta$ (high Pm), which we shall include in
 more in depth future analysis, we do in fact see increased growth rates for
 lower $\eta$, as expected \citep{Sch07}.

In Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-res} the response of the magnetic energy density 
$e_B/\overline{e_K}$ to resolution is shown for resistivity $\eta=10^{-4}$,
panel\,(a) and $\eta=10^{-3}$, panel\,(b).
The time in Myr is plotted on a log scale to better present the differences in 
the higher resolution runs, which saturate much faster than at $\dx=4\pc$.
Whilst for $\eta=10^{-4}$ the dynamo growth rates are very slow at $\dx=4\pc$,
the growth rate shows some convergence near $\dx=0.5\pc$ and the saturation
level of around 5\% of $\overline{e_K}$ is independent of resolution.
%MJK How do we know that we currently capture the correct one?
%FAG Not sure to what 'one' you refer?
%MJK To false/true convergence?
At $\eta=10^{-3}$, there is a false convergence \citep{FMA91} between
$\dx=2$ and $4\pc$, with the magnetic energy decaying at similar
rates. However, at higher resolution we see that the results converge around a
solution with dynamo amplification of the field occurring between
40 and 60~Myr.

%FAG added
For $\dx\geq2\pc$ the growth rate changes sporadically.
Accelerated growth is evident in Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-res}(a) and (b) just
before 20\,Myr, at around 40\,Myr and again at 100\,Myr.
In between there is a lower growth rate or decay, depending on $\dx$ or $\eta$.
This is a consequence of the multiphase structure of the ISM hosting more than
one turbulent regime, in which dynamo modes with different growth rates 
switch over time between subcritical and supercritical for SSD.
%FAG: moved forward from below handle the variation in growth rates and drop hot claim
Amongst the general suite of simulations in addition to those presented in this
letter, some models exhibit the phenomenon of thermal runaway
\citep[see e.g.,][]{LOCBN15}.
The hot gas fills a sufficient fractional volume, that the supernova remnants 
form bubbles, which cannot cool rapidly and the domain becomes saturated 
with hot gas.
Simulations with high resolution are more easily perturbed into this regime, but
also low resolution runs with higher $\dot\sigma$.
The multiphase influence on SSD and cause of the sporadic acceleration of the
dynamo shall be investigated in subsequent study.
%

In Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-nu} we show how at each resolution $e_B/\overline{e_K}$
evolves for various values of $\eta$.
We note that at $\dx=0.5$, panel (a), and $1\pc$, panel (b), the profile at
$\eta=10^{-5}$ is indistinguishable from $\eta=0$, and so numerical resistivity
continues to control the dynamics.
At $\eta=10^{-4}$ the dynamo diverges from $\eta=0$, such that physical
%FAG: take out Rm
%resistivity is dynamically dominant, at least for some of the domain and Rm is
%unevenly defined by a combination of physical and numerical resistivity.
resistivity is dynamically dominant, at least for some of the domain and
unevenly determined by a combination of physical and numerical resistivity.
%FAG: removing Rm
%At all $\dx$ $\eta=10^{-3}$ is clearly well resolved and dynamics and
%Rm well defined by the physical application of resistivity, varying locally with
%$3.8\lesssim\langle\Rm\rangle\lesssim6$, as discussed above from the induction
%equation of $\Rm=15000$ using the common definition. 
At all $\dx$ $\eta=10^{-3}$ is clearly well resolved and dynamics
well defined by the physical application of resistivity.
Although models with the same SN rate have the same schedule and location of
SN, at low resolution the timestep is longer, such that the actual timing and 
environment of the explosions can differ between models, so the statistical
noise is more evident, particularly in panels (e) and (f).


%FAG moved up 
%%FAG: added to paragraph 2 previous 
%%The evolution is complicated by the impact \emph{thermal runaway}
%%\citep[see e.g.,][]{LOCBN15}, combination of multiple SN into superbubbles
%%resulting in persistent hot regions.

%FAG defer this claim to Paper 2
%We observe that during some phases of accelerated dynamo growth, the magnetic
%field is growing most rapidly in the hot gas, whilst during majority of the 
%duration of the runs magnetic fields grow most rapidly in the warm gas and the
%dynamo growth overall follows a lower exponential.
%This is one reason for the complication in characterising the turbulence in 
%these SSDs, with Rm, Pm and $u_{\rm rms}$ varying is space and over time.

%FAG removing Rm and repetition
At first glance the growth profiles might appear to contradict conventional
wisdom with growth rates at high $\eta$ exceeding growth at low $\eta$, for
example, in Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-nu}(a) the growth rate for $\eta=10^{-3}$ (cyan,
dotted) at 19\,Myr is clearly higher than for $\eta=10^{-4}$ (red, dash-dotted)
at 12\,Myr.
However if we understand this in the context of the changing quality of the 
turbulence over time and recognise that the background turbulence evolves in
common for $\dx=0.5$ and 1\,pc, this can be reconciled.
%growth rates for high resistivity (low Rm) can exceed comparable rates for high
%Rm, in contradiction to dynamo theory and previous experimental results.

High Mach number has been demonstrated to impede the SSD in isothermal

In contrast to the simplified model in Section\,\ref{sec:ssd-tang}, SN driven
turbulence does not have a well-defined forcing scale, due to the heterogeneous
temperature and density of the ISM and random clustering of explosions.
%MJK How did you come up with this value?
%FAG: k = 2pi/l, k in kpc^{-1}
%In our simulations the forcing scale will range between
%10 and $50\pc$,
%or $k\in(3,16)$.
In our simulations the forcing scale will be distributed at scales 
greater than about $60\pc$ \citep[][Table\,3]{HSSFG17}, or $k\lesssim17$.
%FAG: clarify choice of time interval
%In Figure\,\ref{fig:4power} we show the evolving compensated spectra for the
%high resolution kinetic energy in the kinematic phase (b) for $\eta=10^{-4}$
%and during decay (d) for $\eta=10^{-3}$.
In Figure\,\ref{fig:4power} we show the evolving compensated spectra for
$\dx=0.5\pc$ between 9 and 32\,Myr.
We compare spectra for $\eta=10^{-4}$, (a) and (b), when the magnetic field is 
amplified to saturation and for $\eta=10^{-3}$, (c) and (d) while the field
persists near seed strength.
The kinetic spectra show the same magnitude fluctuations between the models
over time,
except at 32\,Myr, when saturation of the dynamo, (b), reduces
the energy slightly, compared to (d). 
The compensated magnetic energy spectra in panels (a) and (c) have ranges 
conforming to the Kazantsev inverse cascade in the SSD case (a) extending to
$k\gtrsim 20$, consistent with the SSD behaviour of the simplified model in
Figure\,\ref{fig:tangling}\,(b).
In panel (c) of Figure\,\ref{fig:4power} the Kazantsev range in similar fashion
to Figure\,\ref{fig:tangling}\,(c) is in the range 
$K\lesssim10$ except
for 22\,Myr, which corresponds to a short growth spurt in
Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-res}\,(b) and consistent with the presence of SSD.
So for these SN low Pm models any Kazantsev spectral range dissipates 
at $k$ below the extent of Kolmogorov range.
This makes the SSD in the models even less efficient 
than the high Pm ISM,
where transfer from kinetic energy can occur at every wavenumber in the
Kolmogorov spectrum.

The time, $19.5\Myr$, of the spectral snapshot
corresponds to a common phase of accelerated magnetic growth for $\dx=0.5$ and $1\pc$.
For $\dx=2$ and $4\pc$ the time 100\,Myr corresponds to a period of accelerated
growth at $2\pc$, which is absent in the $4\pc$ model.
The hydrodynamic parameters are fixed for each resolution and are 
consistent between panels (b), (d) and (f).
We note the convergence in the kinetic energy spectrum for
$\dx=0.5\pc$ and $\dx=1\pc$, apart from the energy cutoff at higher $k$
arising from differences in resolution.
Also, the total kinetic energy is reduced with low resolution due to 
increased viscous dissipation acting at lower $k$.

%FAG para break

resolution runs, but with some loss of energy, as does $\dx=4\pc$, but with 
even greater dissipative losses and peak $k\simeq3$.
The kinetic spectra display a bottleneck effect \citep{Falkovich94,HBD03},
%with a bump at $k\simeq50$, 
an energy cascade less efficient than $k^{-5/3}$ terminating at a bump,
before rapid dissipation at high $k$.
This bottleneck shifts to lower $k$ as $\dx$ increases, but always at higher
$k$ than the Kazantsev range in the corresponding magnetic spectrum, reflective
of the low Pm character of these models.

Perhaps surprisingly, there is very little difference in the kinetic energy
spectrum, Figure\,\ref{fig:3power}(h), between simulations with
$\dot\sigma=0.2\SNr$ and $\SNr$, despite five times as much energy being 
applied from the forcing in the latter case.
From the models with $\eta=10^{-3}$ it is evident that there is more energy
near the bottleneck in the high $\dot\sigma$ case (cyan dotted line), so more
energy can be tranferred to the SSD.
The comparison is obscured for $\eta=10^{-4}$, because the high $\dot\sigma$
magnetic field is already 3 or 4 orders of magnitude stronger, aquiring some of
the kinetic energy (red dash-dotted line).
More hot gas from the higher SN rate may also improve the efficiency of SSD,
which we shall investigate in future work. 



\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}

%MJK Now the summary (but it could be also outdated)
%MJK does not really address the main results presented in the paper. 
%MJK 1) SSD can be excited without imposed field present in the system, i.e. the confirmation of Balsara results being not caused by the presence of it, as Detlef thought.
%MJK 2) Convergence (and hopefully a true one) in between 0.5 and 1 pc res, and their implication for the previously published simulations.
%MJK 3) General agreement (hopefully) with the picture of growth rate being somehow related to Rm, and some (maybe forcefully handwavy) estimate of the critical value.
%NS: As Balsara paper talks also about helicity, may be we could briefly say
%NS: that this being SSD is unlikely to be affected by the kinetic helicity
%NS: at least the growth rates.
%MJK But do we know this for sure? Have we looked at the helicity?
%MJK In Miikka's paper we find evidence for kin. helicity making SSD much easier to excite.
%NS: Ok, I recall some papers (also by Axel I think) where helical/non-helical cases
%NS: produced identical growth rates, but this is perhaps minor issue here.
%FAG: added
In this letter we confirm, without the use of an imposed magnetic field, that
the field amplification demonstrated by \citet{BKMM04} was evidence of SSD in
the ISM and not just caused by tangling of their imposed field.
Through the most extensive resolution and parameter study to date, we conclude
that SN driven turbulence easily excites SSD even at SN rates well below the
Galactic value.
Our conclusion is supported by noting that the resistivity of the ISM is far
smaller than we can resolve numerically, so the ISM is far more susceptible to
dynamo action than our models.
Our models with $\dx=0.5$ and $1\pc$ with $\eta=10^{-3}\kpc\kms$ (see
Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-res}b), show that a seed field of less than 1~nG can be
amplified to saturation at microgauss levels within about 10\,Myr.

We further show that simulations with insufficient resolution can appear to
converge to a false solution lacking dynamo activity. This can occur because
these simulations are not scale independent.
The SN energy input and the physically motivated ISM cooling processes impose
length and time scales that must be adequately resolved.
To reach true convergence requires resolution of $1\pc$ or better.
In our models, resolutions $\dx\geq2\pc$ not only give an incorrect dynamo
solution, but also exhibit significant kinetic energy losses due to excess
dissipation.
%FAG added
This also affects the energy spectrum at the largest scales, so should be 
considered when interpreting results using adaptive mesh refinement.
%
We do, however find, independent of resolution, that when an SSD is excited it
saturates at about 5\% of the energy equipartition level.
At low resolution this is a lower bound, because the time-averaged kinetic
energy density is understated, due to dissipative losses.
This might account for the discrepency between the energy density of the mean
magnetic field and the random magnetic field in \citet{Gent:2013b}, due to the
LSD being well resolved while the SSD remained under resolved.

We find that the conventional approach from dynamo theory to categorise the 
turbulence according to Rm based on a forcing scale $\ell$, random velocity and
resistivity, is inadequate for such a complicated system.
%FAG: defer thermal runaway discussion to future paper
%The ISM appears to host at least two regimes of SSD, apparently embedded in the
%hot or warm phases, and with radically different 
%dynamo characteristics and growth rates, and which occupy changing fractional
%volumes and epochs.
%This is further exacerbated by the susceptibility to thermal runaway, which 
%alters the SSD properties.
%Explaining the interaction of these SSDs will require more sophisticated
%statistical and perhaps toplogical techniques, in advance of being able to 
%address how such SSD interacts with LSD.
The ISM appears to host multiple regimes occupying changing fractional volumes
and exciting SSD instabilities with different thresholds and growth rates.
Explaining the interaction of these SSDs will require more sophisticated
statistical and perhaps toplogical techniques, in advance of being able to 
address how such SSD interacts with LSD.
%FAG Moved from above
%FAG: defer thermal runaway discussion to future paper
%Due to the more diffusive numerics there is a reduced susceptibility to
%thermal runaway at low resolution. 
%Higher SN rates may permit coarse models to enter thermal
%runaway and more easily excite SSD, but it is likely that models with 
%$\dx$ much above $4\pc$ will suppress SSD in simulations of the ISM.

%FAG Moved from above
%%FAG removing thermal runaway focus
%To exclude SSD in SN driven turbulence simulations will require 
%$\eta\gtrsim10^{-3}\kpc\kms$ or SN implementation which avoids thermal runaway.
%In \citet{Gressel:2008,GE20}, $\dx$ is 8.3 and $6.7\pc$, respectively
%and $\eta\simeq6.5\cdot10^{-3}\kpc\kms$, which in all probabilty excludes SSD.
%\citet{Gent:2013b} applied $\eta\simeq8\cdot10^{-4}\kpc\kms$ with $\dx=4\pc$,
%which would support SSD with SN rates similar to the solar neighbourhood, even
%without thermal runaway.
With grid resolution $\dx\geq2\pc$ SSD in SN driven turbulence simulations can be
excluded with $\eta\gtrsim10^{-3}\kpc\kms$.
In \citet{Gressel:2008,GE20}, $\dx$ is 8.3 and $6.7\pc$, respectively
and $\eta\simeq6.5\cdot10^{-3}\kpc\kms$, which in all probabilty excludes SSD.
\citet{Gent:2013b} applied $\eta\simeq8\cdot10^{-4}\kpc\kms$ with $\dx=4\pc$,
which would support SSD with SN rates similar to the solar neighbourhood.
The latter obtain an LSD with galactic angular momentum $\Omega=\OSN$, where
$\OSN=25\kms\kpc^{-1}$ is the rate in the solar neighbourhood.
The former require $\Omega\geq4\OSN$ to excite LSD.
Rm applying at the largest scales would be 7.5 times higher for the latter 
model, so alone is sufficient to explain the LSD at lower $\Omega$.
%FAG: added
Early efforts by \citet{Korpi:1999b} were unable to detect even the LSD.
With a resolution even less than \citet{Gressel:2008} $\Omega\gg\OSN$ would be 
required to excite the LSD, and an SSD would be ruled out.
%
%FAG: added
For grid resolution $\dx\leq1\pc$ SSD cannot yet be excluded with 
$\eta\leq10^{-3}\kpc\kms$, 
unless the regime inducing the accelerated growth rates can be identified
and excluded from the SSD, which will be a focus of our continued investigation.
The higher $\eta$ required to otherwise exclude SSD, may also suppress LSD, for
modest $\Omega$.
%How the SSD affects the galactic dynamo requires further study.
%FAG added ???? Not sure this is actually so relevant having read it? Though I find it puzzling that they have SSD but no LSD
%Using an SPH code \citet{SBADMN19} report an SSD in a global galaxy simulation
%with minimum resolution equivalent to about 20\,pc.
%In this model the SN are not directly modelled and the turbulence is driven
%on a much larger forcing scale by the galactic wind and fountain.
%The disk height is relatively small-scale in the model, so the LSD model
%to which this letter is a preliminary step, might appropriately fit into
%design of a subgrid-scale model for their halo model.
%%

%FAG Moved from above
%As shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-nu}(a) and (b), turbulence 
%can excite accelerated SSD even with high resistivity in galaxies that
%sustain regions of hot gas.
%To understand this we shall examine the nature of the acceleration of the
%dynamo in a later submission.

We present a numerical resolution study over a range of magnetic resistivity
(and by implication magnetic Reynolds number, Rm) to identify characteristics
of the small-scale dynamo (SSD) under supernova-driven turbulence of the
interstellar medium (ISM).
We confirm that conditions in the ISM are likely highly conducive to SSD in the
diffuse hot and warm turbulent ISM, given Rm in the real ISM is orders of
magnitude higher than we model at our highest resolution and a modest SN
%explosion frequency ($\SNr$), 20\% that of the solar neighbourhood.

%FAG: yes in ssdyn_paper I now added tables for sigma=\SNr and mean Ms increases

%MJK No, unfortunately not. We have runs with nu=0, meaning nu_SGS only,

Across the modelled range of 0.5 to 4 parsec resolution we find with

With higher resistivity required to resolve the magnetic field as resolution becomes
more coarse the trend suggests the small scale dynamo cannot be excited for grid

%MJK The landscape to me seems to be the following:
%MJK GE20 do not explicitely state that they do not have SSD, but do go forward with QKTFM, which assumes that no magnetic background turbulence is present, hence they make an implicit claim of having no SSD.
%MJK Balsara04 clearly had a SSD, as LSD was not allowed for, but had an imposed
%MJK field, and the role of that is unclear.
%MJK Fred+gang claim LSD and SSD, but it is unclear whether this is true, as
%MJK separating SSD and LSD is difficult.
%MJK Steinwandel et al. have recently claimed that a SSD is present in a
%MJK galactic-scale simulation, but no LSD, and that SSD "dies" off at later
%MJK stages, when Kazantsev scaling is not observed.
%MJK So, our study now tries to address at which resolution a fully healthy
%MJK SSD can be expected in a full ISM simulation, and helps to interpret
%MJK the mess descripbed above.
%MJK Now we DO not have imposed field, and can confirm the conclusions of Balsara04
%MJK without it.
%MJK It would be interesting if a critical Rm could be nailed down, but I doubt we
%MJK can, and must resort to what is listed above.
%FAG 28.9 reword

This letter addresses the necessary conditions for and nature of small-scale
dynamo (SSD) in the interstellar medium (ISM).
SSD are dynamo modes acting at small eddy scales of the turbulence.
There are large scales of separation between the fastest growing SSD
instabilities and the large-scale dynamo (LSD) modes generating the magnetic
field structures organised at the systemic scales of the galactic disk, spiral
arms, or similar.
As such, modelling simulations capable of capturing the LSD alongside the faster
growing modes of SSD are computationally challenging.
However, it is likely that the interaction of SSD modes with LSD fundamentally
alter the evolution and structure of the magnetic field.

In many simulations of supernova driven turbulence with realistic vertical 
stratification \citep[e.g.,][]{deAvillez:2005,PO07,Hill:2012a,HI14} the
mechanisms for inducing large scale magnetic fields are absent, such as rotation
and shear.
To examine the effect of strong ordered magnetic fields these models then rely
on imposition of a background or initial magnetic field, typically uniform,
which is then perturbed by supernova explosions.
The amplification of the magnetic field in these cases may include a small scale
dynamo in case of sufficiently high magnetic Reynolds numbers, Rm, but any
amplification of the field is limited to linear growth through
tangling of the imposed field.
%\ns{The above sentence seems to suggest (linear) growth of large-scale field,
%but one might argue that tangling produces fields preferably on %the forcing
%scale, thus essentially leading to (linear) growth of fluctuating %field.
%(Aside) Interestingly, I think, it is only the tangling produced %magnetic
%noise (and not the SSD) which leads to quenching of large-scale %dynamo, as
%$\alpha_M$ is sourced primarily by tangling.}
%MJK see above; is it so easily solved, Nishant?
%NS: Yes, agreed. I will keep the comments above for now as I can formulate
%NS: a sentence on the Aside part which could be useful
Any initial large scale field would diffuse leaving only the random field. 
If an imposed field is sufficiently close to equipartition its characteristics
would dominate any MHD results.
%NS: added; pls feel free to decide whether it should be kept here or not
It is reasonable to expect that the tangling produced magnetic noise
will grow exponentially if the system supports the LSD instability.
Such a noise plays an important role in quenching the LSD by contributing
to the magnetic $\alpha$-effect $\alpha_M$ which leads to the saturation
of large-scale fields in the nonlinear regime.
%NS.

More commonly models of supernova driven dynamo in the ISM have ignored the 
large scale effects and examined the small scale dynamo or the effect of the
turbulent magnetic field on the properties of the ISM
\citep[e.g.,][]{BKMM04,BalKim05,MacLow:2005}.
A seed or imposed field for such models could be uniform or random, but if the
simulated field results from tangling rather than dynamo, then any conclusions
about the ISM depend on the veracity of the chosen field rather than the 
nature of the MHD turbulence.

While the SN experiments considered in this letter are restricted to SSD, some
large scale models do include the large scale dynamo
\citep[e.g.,][]{Gressel:2008,HWK09,WA09,Gent:2013b,EGSFB16,Pakmor17,SBADMN19,SDLMBP20,GE20}.
Most of these do not include a small scale dynamo.
%\citet{Gent:2013b,EGSFB16} do include SSD, but without a clear

\citet{Gent:2013b,EGSFB16} do appear to include SSD, but without a clear
understanding of the characteristics of this SSD it is difficult to explore the
effect this has on the large scale dynamo (LSD) and the properties of the ISM.
%FAG: revised
%\citet{SBADMN19,SDLMBP20} also suspect they have SSD.
\citet{SBADMN19,SDLMBP20} also claim that SSD is present in a galactic-scale
simulation, but do not excite LSD. 
At late stage the SSD ceases corresponding to the disappearance of Kazantsev
scaling in the magnetic power spectra.
%FAG: ended and new para

%FAG: added
Given the uncertainty over the presence of SSD in the large scale simulations
we seek to confirm how to identify, quantify and characterise SSD, so that we
can adequately interpret its action in simulations of LSD.
\citet{BKMM04} report SSD in ideal MHD, but with only numerical diffusion and
a limited set of resolution and parameters it is not possible to demonstrate 
convergence of the solutions nor dependence on Rm or magnetic Prandtl number, Pm.
They include a weak imposed uniform field, and we shall show that it is possible
to demonstrate conclusively that the amplification of their field is a result of
dynamo action and not just tangling of the field.
%
In this letter we explore the SSD in realistic simulations of SN driven 
turbulence

in isolation from any drivers of LSD.
%
The broad resolution and parameter study is intended to identify the critical
ranges for excitation of SSD and understand dynamo growth rates and saturation 
conditions.
This will also identify the prerequisites for including or excluding SSD in the
LSD models and subsequently establish the importance of SSD-LSD interactions 
on galaxy dynamics. 
We aim to find objective criteria with which to determine the presence of SSD in 
simulations \citep[such as][]{Gent:2013b,GE20,SDLMBP20}.

\end{figure*}
%==============================================================================

To illustrate some differences between tangling and small scale dynamo we adopt
a simplified model with non-helical random forcing with wavenumber $\kf=8$
applied to isothermal uniform density in $256^3$ $2\pi$-periodic boxes.
A uniform field with energy density $e_B\simeq6\cdot10^{-22}\overline{e_K}$ is
imposed, where $\overline{e_K}$ is the time-averaged kinetic energy density.
The two simulations are distinguished only by use of dimensionless
$\eta=10^{-4}$, exciting a small scale dynamo, and $\eta=2\cdot10^{-3}$
subcritical for dynamo.
Our numerical implementations use the {\sc Pencil Code}\footnote{
\href{https://github.com/pencil-code}{https://github.com/pencil-code}}.

We plot some of the diagnostics from the results of these two simulations in 
Figure\,\ref{fig:tangling}.
Panel (a) illustrates that the small scale dynamo is characterised by
exponential growth just over 400 eddy turnover times; see \cite{ZRS83} for the
properties and excitation conditions of SSD.
Tangling results only in linear amplification early on (see inset), saturating
within 100 eddy turnover times at below 5 times the imposed field energy
density.

In panel (b) we plot for the SSD model some power spectra for the magnetic
energy, evolving over time alongside a kinetic energy spectrum at late stage.
The magnetic energy spectra are compensated by $k^{-3/2}$ and kinetic by
$k^{5/3}$.
A profile becoming horizontal, therefore, corresponds to the Kazantsev's
$3/2$ scaling \citep{Sch02,BS14} or the Kolomogorov turbulent energy spectrum.
In panel (c) see we show similar for the tangling model.
The forcing scale $\kf=8$ is evident in the kinetic spectra and highlighted by 
a vertical dotted line.
The SSD magnetic spectrum (b) evolves near self-similarly, with an uncompensated
peak wavenumber above 20 at early times reducing to below 20 upon saturation of
the dynamo.
The forcing scale has negligible effect on the magnetic spectra.
However, for the tangling case (c) the peak wavenumber for the magnetic energy
spectrum is strongly identified with the forcing scale.
The Kazantsev range of the spectrum extends to wavenumbers larger than the 
forcing scale for SSD, while confined to larger scales for the field with
tangling only.

%NS: commenting out the following
%\ns{Added 5 new references in refs.bib to quote earlier works on Kazantsev, low/high
%Pm SSD; we can include those here as \citet{K68,KA92}; \cite{Sch02} (high Pm);
%\cite{Sch07} (low Pm); \cite{BS14} (finite correlation time). Please feel free
%to remove any from these that appear unsuitable here.}

Given the high magnetic Prandtl numbers, the magnetic spectra retain more energy
%NS: is it high or low Pm meant in the line above (abstract has low only)
%NS: but i agree that at high Pm, M_k > E_k at large k
%FAG: in these experiments the PM are high, but in the SN runs they are low Pm
%FAG: although we have some runs with high Pm for inclusion in the full paper.
at smaller scales than the kinetic spectra.
Although the kinetic parameters are identical and are subject to the same 
viscous cutoff, the SSD extends the kinetic energy into the larger scales
due to the feedback from the Lorentz force.
With SSD there is a short inertial range for $10\leq k/k_1\lesssim 15$.
Thus, in the dynamo kinetic energy deposited along the Kolmogorov range to
smaller scales transfers energy to the magnetic field at these scales
inducing an inverse Kazantsev range begining at scales below the forcing
scale, while with tangling the energy transfers to the magnetic field
only at scales between the forcing scale and scale of the imposed field.
There is only dissipation of the field at scales smaller than the Kazantsev 
range.

\section{SN turbulence model design} \label{sec:model}


%MJK We should mention that the domain is not subject to rotation, shear, nor stratification. And also in most cases no imposed field, I guess? 
To exclude any large scale magnetic field dynamics in these simulations, the
computational domain occupies a cube of length 120 pc, with periodic boundaries
on all sides.
Grid size $\delta x=0.5$, 1, 2 and 4$\pc$  along each side are considered.

Many symbols have their usual meaning, and a table (\ref{sec:table}) is included in the appendix
for clarity.
In particular, terms containing $\zeta_D,\,\zeta_\nu$ and $\zeta_\eta$ are the
application of artificial diffusion acting proportional to shocks in 
Eqs.\,\eqref{eq:mass},\,\eqref{eq:mom} and \eqref{eq:ent}, respectively.
This machinery is described in detail in \citet{GMKSH20}, which is included to
resolve shock discontinuities.
Shock diffusion is not applied to Eq.\,\eqref{eq:ind}, where it would result in 
unphysical dissipation of the magnetic field in the shock fronts, when in fact 
here it is highly enhanced by compression.
In Eqs.\,\eqref{eq:mom} -- \eqref{eq:ind}, expressions containing 
$\nu_3,\,\chi_3$ and $\eta_3$ apply sixth-order hyperdiffusion applying primarily
at the grid scale to resolve small-scale instabilities \citep[see, e.g.,][]{ABGS02,HB04}.

The supernovae are injected randomly uniform in 3D space and as a

 $\SNr\simeq 50\kpc^{-3}\Myr^{-1}$. 
Each explosion injects $10^{51}\erg$ as thermal energy, $\EST$, but in 
dense media a small proportion may be in kinetic energy, $\ESK$.
This is described in detail by \citet{GMKSH20}.
Non-adiabatic heating, $\Gamma$, and cooling, $\Lambda$, processes are included
following \citet{Wolfire:1995} and \citet{Sarazin:1987}, as described in

%MJK Somewhere we should point out that this strategy, in effect, results in us considering low Pm flows only. This is not ideal for the ISM, of course, but maybe our excuse here is that this regime is known to be more difficult for the SSD in any case, as then the eta cut off is places in the inertial range of the kinetic turbulence, hence most of our conclusions should definitely hold for the ISM.
In the subset of experiments presented in this letter we set viscosity, $\nu=0$,
with $\nu_3$ applying optimally for each $\dx$ to ensure the flow is 
well resolved.
We establish a benchmark for the magnetic field evolution setting $\eta=0$, with
numerical resistivity acting via the optimal setting for $\eta_3$.
We then vary $\eta\geq10^{-6}\kpc\kms$ to identify minimal range for which the physical
resistivity is dynamically dominating the numerical resistivity, and examine the
dependence of the dynamo on $\nu$ and grid resolution.
Henceforth, where $\eta$ is specified for the SN simulations it has units of $\kpc\kms$. 
In contrast to our earlier experiments \citep{Gent:2013a,Gent:2013b,GMKSH20},
we do not include thermal diffusivity, $\chi$, in these experiments as 
the artificial diffusivities are adequate to ensure numerical stability and
the physical effects of thermal conductivity can be expected to be relevant only
at time and spatial scales much shorter than considered here.
\fag{Mordecai, could you suggest some appropriate reference?}

An important consideration in dynamo theory is the magnetic Reynolds number, Rm,
and the magnetic Prandtl number, $\Pm = \Rm/\Rey \simeq \nu/\eta$, where $\Rey$
is the fluid Reynolds number.
A commonly used definition is \[\Rm=\frac{\ell u_{\rm rms}}{\eta},\] where
$\ell$ is the forcing scale.
However, in these simulations of the ISM, given the Galilean invariance of the 
turbulence, variation within hot and warm medium, and inclusion of
hyperdiffusion, defining a single forcing scale from the SN explosions or 
common rms velocity is unreliable.
We, therefore, directly compute a field of Reynolds numbers from the equations,
for example,
\begin{eqnarray}
  \Rm = \frac{\left|\vect{u}\times\vect{B}\right|}{
    \left|\eta\vect\nabla^2\vect{A}+\eta_3\vect\nabla^6\vect{A}\right|}.
\end{eqnarray}
Hence, for the high resolution runs at 20\,Myr we obtain linear 
$\langle\Rm\rangle=4$ with standard deviation 5.6, whereas 
$\Rm = 15000$, for $\eta=10^{-4}$, $\ell=50\pc$ and $u_{\rm rms}=30\kms$ using
the common formula.
In this suite of experiments, with $\nu=0$ and $\nu_3=\eta_3$ sufficient to
numerically resolve the grid scale, $\Pm<1$, which is an even more difficult
regime in which to excite the small scale dynamo than in the high $\Pm$
regime typical of the ISM.
In separate experiments with high Pm, which we shall include in the more in
depth future analysis, we do in fact see increased growth rates for higher
Pm.

\label{fig:eb-nu}}
\end{figure*}

In Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-res} the response of the magnetic energy density 
$e_B/\overline{e_K}$ to resolution is shown
for resistivity $\eta=10^{-4}$, panel\,(a) and
$\eta=10^{-3}$, panel\,(b).
The time in Myr is plotted on a log scale to better present the differences in 
the higher resolution runs, which saturate much faster then the $\dx=4\pc$ 
run.
Whilst for $\eta=10^{-4}$ the dynamo growth rates are very slow at $\dx=4\pc$,
the growth rate shows some convergence near $\dx=0.5\pc$ and 
the saturation level of above 5\% of $\overline{e_K}$ is independent of
resolution. 
%MJK How do we know that we currently capture the correct one? 
At $\eta=10^{-3}$, there is a \emph{false convergence} \citep{FMA91}
between $\dx=2$ and $4\pc$,
with the magnetic energy decaying at similar rates, however at higher resolution
we see that the results converge around an alternative solution, with a dynamo
amplification of the field occurring between 400 and 600\,Myr.

In Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-nu} we show how at each resolution $e_B/\overline{e_K}$
evolves for various values of $\eta$.
We note that at $\dx=0.5$, panel (a), and $1\pc$, panel (b), the profile
at $\eta=10^{-5}$ is indistinguishable from $\eta=0$, and so numerical
resistivity continues to control the dynamics.
At $\eta=10^{-4}$ the dynamo diverges from $\eta=0$, such that physical resistivity
is dynamically dominant, at least for some of the domain and Rm is unevenly
defined by combination of physical and numerical resistivity.
At all $\dx$ $\eta=10^{-3}$ is clearly well resolved and dynamics and
%MJK Has Rm been defined? I think we should try to make a connection to earlier studies by using the "standard" definition, and then the one directly computing from the code as a ratio of the relevant terms. 
Rm well defined by the physical application of resistivity.
%MJK This sounds like belonging to the simulation design, and not in the middle of results.
To reduce statistical noise, at all $\dx$ and $\eta$ the supernova are
scheduled at the same time and coordinates for $\dot\sigma=0.2\SNr$,
panels (a) -- (d), and for $\dot\sigma=\SNr$, panels (e) -- (f).
For low resolution the timestep is longer, such that the actual timing and 
environment of the explosions can differ between models, so the statistical
noise is more evident, particularly in panels (e) and (f). 

%MJK Would help if it was not introduced as a complication, but explained first as behavior seen in the figure, then given an explanation, and then convincing the reader that what is seen now only in Figs 3 a,b as puzzling, we can easily explain in these terms.
%MJK Overall remark of the figures: There are plenty of white space in between, and the figure captions are complicated. Use some of this white space to give more information in the title, for example:
%MJK In Fig. 3: SN rate in the title, perhaps together with the delta x?
%MJK Fig. 4: add a subplot to the kinetic energy spectra, showing the same in linear scale, to emphasize the bottleneck? Indicate eta values in the title of each plot? Times simply as smooth transition in color, without the multiple legends, extrema values and amount of increments in the caption?
%MJK Fig. 5: eta values in the title of each plot ((a) - (f)); resolution (g)-(h)?
The evolution is complicated by the impact \emph{thermal runaway}
\citep[see e.g.,][]{LOCBN15}, combination of multiple SN into superbubbles
resulting in persistent hot regions.
We shall report analysis of these results in depth in future work, but an 
initial observation of the growth profiles could lead to the conclusion that
growth rates for high resistivity (low Rm) can exceed comparable rates for high
Rm, in contradiction to dynamo theory and previous experimental results.
Closer inspection of each plot, zooming in on specific intervals, however,
confirms that growth rates are higher as expected for higher Rm.
For example between 8 and 15 Myr there is weak growth or decay in panels (a)
and (b) with critical $\eta$ for dynamo between $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$.
Rm and corresponding growth at low $\eta$ is higher in the $0.5\pc$ simulation
with lower numerical resistivity, but 
converge for $\eta=10^{-3}$, where the physical resistivity is most resolved.
Between 15 and 20\,Myr there is a fast dynamo driven in the hot gas, in which
growth rates are related to the level of resistivity.
The high Rm models at $0.5\pc$ already saturate by 20\,Myr, but for $1\pc$ there
is another slow dynamo driven in the warm gas up to 40\,Myr and then a
subsequent 'hot' dynamo resulting in saturation for all models within 60\,Myr,
including for $\eta=10^{-3}$.

%MJK Now we have too many different names for this dynamo: hot, fast, and what not. Should choose one.
At low resolution, with $\dot\sigma=0.2\SNr$ panels (c) and (d), $\eta=10^{-4}$
is not distinct from numerical resistivity, and there is no hot dynamo at all
for $\dx=4\pc$ with the well resolved $\eta=10^{-3}$.
At 100\,Myr there is a hot dynamo at $\dx=2\pc$, but this is not
sustained and for $\eta=10^{-3}$ susbequently diffuses away.
At $\dot\sigma=\SNr$, panels (e) and (f), the increased Rm due to the 
higher forcing rate is sufficient to produce a dynamo at $\eta\geq10^{-3}$, but
not for $\eta=5\cdot10^{-3}$.
Given the increased statistical noise we cannot confirm that $\eta\leq10^{-4}$
applies beyond the numerical resistivity.
However, at $\dx=2\pc$ $\eta=5\cdot10^{-4}$ (magenta, solid) is resolved and at $\dx=4\pc$
 the resolved limit is $\eta\lesssim10^{-3}$ (cyan, dotted).
In panel (e) we see two hot dynamo phases at 90  and 110\,Myr, which are not 
present in panel (f).
There is a reduced susceptibility to thermal runaway at low resolution, 
and only lower Rm can be resolved, both an effect of more diffusive numerics.
Hence, as the resolution becomes more coarse it is likely that the small-scale 
dynamo will be suppressed in simulations of the ISM.
Higher supernova rates driving increased velocities may permit coarse models 
to attain the critical Rm for SSD, but it is likely that models with 
$\dx$ much above $4\pc$ will suppress the dynamo. 

To attain a truly convergent numerical regime simulations should apply 
resolution better than $2\pc$.
In the ISM with Rm much higher than we can resolve, our results confirm that
SSD is very easy to excite by SN, and may even be present in galaxies with
low SN rates.
As shown in panels (a) and (b), properties of the hot gas cannot exclude
SSD even with high resistivity in galaxies that produce sustained regions of
hot turbulence.
We shall examine the nature of this fast dynamo in a later report.
To exclude SSD in SN driven turbulence simulations will require
$\eta\gtrsim10^{-3}$ or supernova implementation which avoids thermal runaway.
In \citet{Gressel:2008,GE20}, $\dx$ is 8.3 and $6.7\pc$, respectively
and $\eta\simeq6.5\cdot10^{-3}\kpc\kms$, which excludes SSD,
while \citet{Gent:2013b} applied $\eta\simeq8\cdot10^{-4}\kpc\kms$ with $\dx=4\pc$,
which would support SSD, even without thermal runaway.
The latter obtain a large scale dynamo with galactic angular momentum
$\Omega=\OSN$, where $\OSN=25\kms\kpc^{-1}$ is the rate in the solar
neighbourhood, while the former require $\Omega\geq4\OSN$ to excite LSD.
Rm applying at the largest scales would be 7.5 times higher for the latter 
model, so alone is sufficient to explain the LSD.
How the SSD affects the galactic dynamo requires further study.

\end{figure*}

In contrast to the simplified model in Section\,\ref{sec:ssd-tang}, SN driven
turbulence does not have a well-defined forcing scale, due to the heterogeneous
temperature and density of the ISM and random clustering of explosions.
In our simulations the forcing scale will range between 10 and $50\pc$,
or $k\in(3,16)$.
In Figure\,\ref{fig:4power} we show the evolving compensated spectra for the
high resolution kinetic energy in the kinematic phase (b) for $\eta=10^{-4}$
and during decay (d) for $\eta=10^{-3}$.
The spectra magnitude show the same fluctuations over time, except at 32\,Myr,
when the dynamo saturates and reduces slightly of the energy in (b) compared
to (d). 
Many of the spectra display a \emph{bottleneck} effect \fag{reference tba} with
a peak at $k\simeq50$.
The compensated magnetic energy spectra in panels (a) and (c) have ranges 
conforming to the Kazantsev inverse cascade in the SSD case (a) extending to
$k\gtrsim 20$, consistent with the SSD behaviour of the toy model in
Figure\,\ref{fig:tangling}\,(b).
In panel (c) of Figure\,\ref{fig:4power} the Kazantsev range in similar fashion
to Figure\,\ref{fig:tangling}\,(c) is in the range $K\lesssim10$ except
for 22\,Myr, which corresponds to a short growth spurt in
Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-res}\,(b) and consistent with the presence of SSD.

%MJK The bottleneck in the kinetic energy spectra seems independent of Pm EXCEPT for the high SN rate case. Why should that be so different?
In Figure\,\ref{fig:3power} panels (a) -- (f) the effect of resolution on the
compensated energy spectra is shown for $\eta=0$, $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$
with $\dot\sigma=0.2\SNr$.
The time of the spectral snapshot for $\dx=0.5$ and $1\pc$ correspond to a
common phase of rapid magnetic growth fastest in the hot gas, while for
$\dx=2$ and $4\pc$ it corresponds to a period of hot-phase rapid growth at
$2\pc$, which is absent in the $4\pc$ model with low $\dot\sigma$.
The hydrodynamic parameters are fixed for each resolution and are 
consistent between panels (b), (d) and (f).
We note that, there is convergence in the kinetic energy spectrum for
$\dx=0.5\pc$ and $\dx=1\pc$, apart from the energy cutoff at higher $k$
consistent with higher resolution.
Also, the total kinetic energy is reduced with low resolution due to 
increased viscous dissipation acting at lower $k$.
To fully resolve the kinetic energetics for scales larger than $k=24$ corresponding to $\ell\simeq40\pc$ would therefore require $\dx\gtrsim1\pc$.
The energy spectrum at $\dx=2\pc$ shares the same characterstics as the high
resolution runs, but with some loss of energy.

There is a bottleneck evident, an energy cascade less efficient than $k^{-5/3}$
terminating at a peak, before rapid dissipation at high $k$.
This bottleneck shifts to lower $k$ as $\dx$ increases, but always at higher
$k$ than the Kazantsev range in the corresponding magnetic spectrum.

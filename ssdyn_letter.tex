%% is still the collaboration identifier. The text given in this
%% argument is what will be shown in the manuscript. The first argument
%% is the number of author above the \collaboration command to show with
%% the collaboration text. If there are authors that are not part of any
%% collaboration the \nocollaboration command is used. This command takes
%% one argument which is also the number of authors above to show. A
%% dashed line is shown to indicate no collaboration. This example manuscript
%% shows how these commands work to display specific set of authors 
%% on the front page.

\begin{abstract}
Magnetic fields grow quickly even at early cosmological times, suggesting the
action of a small-scale dynamo (SSD) in the interstellar medium of galaxies.
Many studies have focused on idealized turbulent driving of the SSD. 
Here we simulate more realistic supernova-driven turbulence to determine
whether it can drive an SSD.
\mm{Magnetic field growth occurring in our models appears consistent
  with SSD action, and inconsistent with simple tangling of magnetic fields.}
We vary the physical resistivity, \fg{$\eta$}, as well as the numerical
resolution and supernova rate, $\dot\sigma$, to delineate the regime in which
an SSD occurs.
For a given $\dot\sigma$ we find convergence for SSD growth rate with
resolution \fg{of a parsec}.
\fg{For $\dot\sigma\simeq\SNr$, with $\SNr$ the solar neighbourhood rate,
the critical resistivity \mm{below} which an SSD occurs is
$0.005>\eta_{\rm crit}>0.001{\,\rm kpc}^{-1}{\,\rm km~ s}^{-1}$, and this
increases with the supernova rate.}
Across the modelled range of 0.5 to 4~\fg{pc} resolution we find that for
\fg{$\eta<\eta{\rm crit}$}, the SSD saturates at about 5\% of kinetic energy
equipartion, independent of growth rate.
\fg{In the range $0.2\SNr\leq \dot\sigma\leq8\SNr$ growth rate increases
with $\dot\sigma$, despite the negative impact expected from increased
Mach numbers.
SSD\fg{s} \mm{in the supernova-driven interstellar medium} commonly exhibit erratic growth.}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
%==============================================================================


 This \fg{L}etter addresses the necessary conditions and properties of a
 small-scale dynamo (SSD) in the interstellar medium (ISM).
 %FAG: trim
 %SSD acts at small eddy scales of the turbulence, thus driving magnetic field
 SSD acts at small eddy scales of turbulence, driving magnetic field
 growth at correspondingly short \mjk{timescales}.
 \fg{The large-scale dynamo (LSD) with much longer turnover times generates
 magnetic fields ordered on \fg{kiloparsec} scales.}
 %FAG: trim
 %Hence, simulations capable of capturing LSD alongside the faster growing modes
 %of SSD are computationally challenging.
 Hence, capturing LSD alongside the faster growing modes
 of SSD in simulations is computationally challenging.
 However, \fg{interaction between SSD and LSD modes likely fundamentally}
 \fg{determines the} evolution and structure of the magnetic field.

 Many simulations of supernova- (SN)-driven turbulence with realistic vertical
 stratification \citep[e.g.,][]{deAvillez:2005,PO07,Hill:2012a,HI14} have no
 mechanism to induce LSD, such as rotation and shear.
 %FAG: trim
 %The effect of strong ordered magnetic fields is modelled by
 %imposition of a background, typically uniform, magnetic field.
 Strong ordered magnetic field effects are modelled by
 imposition of a background, typically uniform, magnetic field.
 \fg{Some large-scale models do seek to include LSD 
 \citep[e.g.,][]{Korpi:1999b,Gressel:2008,HWK09,WA09,Pakmor17,
 GE20}, but show no SSD, or appear to find SSD 
 within the context of halo-disk
 scale flows \citep[e.g.,][]{RT16,SBADMN19},  but capture no LSD.}
 %\mjk{Is Evirgen a separate model, or just using data from Gent+2013?}
\citet[][with additional analysis by \citealt{EGSFB16}]{Gent:2013b}
% mm \mjk{\citep[additional analysis][]{} does}
 appear to include an \fg{SSD with} \fg{an} \fg{LSD}.
 To confirm this and determine its effect on LSD, we must understand the
 properties of the SSD.
     
 Any magnetic noise produced by tangling \fg{of a large-scale field}
 %\mjk{not an expert on hyphens, but I think here should be one}
 will also grow exponentially \fg{if an LSD is} present.
 %FAG: trim
 %This noise plays an important role in quenching the LSD due to the magnetic
 %$\alpha$-effect, causing saturation of large-scale fields.
 This noise \fg{can play} an important role in quenching the LSD.
 We need to discriminate this effect from an SSD.   

 Previous experiments (\mjk{\citealp[e.g.,][hereafter \BKM]{BKMM04};
 \citealp{BalKim05,MacLow:2005}})
 examined the SN-driven SSD.
 %\mjk{Here we are wasting words; just add (BKMM4) after the reference proper}
 %SSD\fg{, the former of which we shall henceforth
 %identify as \BKM}.
 \fg{The limited  resolution} \fg{study} \fg{of \BKM\ did not allow
 demonstration of \fg{solution} convergence.
 %\mjk{plural? Dependencies?}
 %FAG: trim
 %Dependencies on magnetic Reynolds (Rm) or Prandtl (Pm) numbers was not
 %explored due to use of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).}
 %They included a weak imposed uniform field; we shall show
 %that the amplification of their field is a result
 %of SSD action and not just tangling of the field.
 Applying a weak imposed uniform field with ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD),
 dependencies on magnetic Reynolds (Rm) or Prandtl (Pm) numbers were not
 explored.}
 We shall show that the amplification of their field is a result
 of SSD action and not just tangling of the field.

 In this {\fg L}etter we \fg{first} compare the SSD to tangling in an idealized
 simulation (Sect.~\ref{sec:ssd-tang})\fg{.
 %FAG: trim
 %We} \fg{then describe} \fg{simulations of SN-driven turbulence, excluding any
 %drivers of an LSD to} \fg{demonstrate the action} \fg{of SSD
 %(Sect.~\ref{sec:model}).} 
 %Our \fg{simulations} use the {\sc Pencil Code}\footnote{
 We then describe our models of SN-driven turbulence for demonstrating the
 action of SSD (Sect.~\ref{sec:model}).} 
 \fg{Simulations} use the {\sc Pencil Code}\footnote{
 \href{https://github.com/pencil-code}{https://github.com/pencil-code}}.
 A broad resolution and parameter study allows us to \fg{show numerical}
 \fg{convergence and} \fg{determine} the critical resistivity for excitation
 of an SSD, \fg{which we follow} to saturation (Sect.~\ref{sec:results}).
 This provides objective criteria \fg{for the action} of SSD in simulations
 \citep[such as][]{Gent:2013b,GE20,SBADMN19}.
 Finally, we conclude in Sect.~\ref{sec:conc}.

\section{Disentangling the dynamo} \label{sec:ssd-tang}
%==============================================================================

 \fg{Previous SSD studies have examined Pm dependence with %\fg{uniform}
 \mjk{stochastic} %; uniform alone gives a weird impression...}
 nonhelical forcing, including \fg{at} high Mach number \citep[e.g.,][]{ 
 HBD03,HBD04,Haugen:2004M,FCSBKS11,FSBS14}.} %\mjk{The above-mentioned models were equally simple, and now we make it sound like we do something even more simple, which is not true}
 \mjk{Here we specifically seek t}o illustrate
 differences between tangling and SSD.
 Nonhelical random forcing is applied at wavenumber $\kf/k_1=8$ to
 $256^3$ zone, $2\pi$-periodic, isothermal boxes.
 The lowest wavenumber in the domain is $k_1=1$ and the largest is the Nyquist
 frequency $k/k_1 = 128$.
 The imposed uniform field has $e_B\simeq6\cdot10^{-22}~\overline{e_K}$, where
 $\overline{e_K}$ is the time-averaged kinetic energy density.
 Two simulations are distinguished by use of dimensionless
 resistivity $\eta=10^{-4}$
 and $\eta=2\cdot10^{-3}$ and viscosity $\nu=5\cdot10^{-3}$.
 These yield $\Rm=150$, with $\Pm = 50$, exciting \fg{an} SSD, and $\Rm=7.4$
 with $\Pm=2.5$, inhibiting the dynamo so that amplification is limited to
 tangling of the imposed field.

 Figure\,\ref{fig:tangling}\,(a) shows the SSD growing exponentially in just
 over 400 eddy turnover times; see \cite{ZRS83} for SSD properties and
 excitation conditions.
 Tangling induces only linear growth (see inset), saturating just above
 the imposed field energy within 50 turnover times.

 \fg{Figures~\ref{fig:tangling}(b) and~\ref{fig:tangling}\,(c) show
 compensated power spectra for both cases.}
 Magnetic energy spectra are compensated \fg{for by} Kazantsev's $k^{3/2}$
 \fg{power law} \citep{Sch02,BS14}, and kinetic energy \fg{by} Kolmogorov's
 $k^{-5/3}$.
 The forcing scale $\kf$ is \fg{prominent} in kinetic energy \fg{spectra for
 both models} and the magnetic energy \fg{spectra of the tangling}, but
 \fg{not} \fg{in the magnetic spectra of the SSD}.
 \fg{For SSD the range with Kazantsev power law (horizontal) extends to scales
 smaller than the forcing scale (Figure~\ref{fig:tangling}\,b), and during the
 kinematic phase the magnetic energy peak is at $k/k_1\simeq9$.}
 \fg{For tangling (Figure~\ref{fig:tangling}\,c) the Kazantsev
 \fg{scaling} applies only at $k/k_1<\kf$.} 
 Thus, in the SSD, kinetic energy \fg{in the Kolmogorov cascade} transfers to
 \mjk{magnetic energy} 
 %\mjk{energy transfers to field; energy should transfer to energy}
 at these scales, inducing an inverse Kazantsev \fg{cascade}
 at scales \fg{smaller than} $\kf$, while tangling transfers energy only at
 scales between $\kf$ and the scale of the imposed field.
% FAG: could be said more clearly with more words, but not realy needed.
% Dissipation \fg{characterises} scales below the Kazantsev range.
% \mjk{what does this mean? Dissipation occurs at scales smaller than the scale where Kazantsev scaling ends?}

\subsection{\fg{Resolution and convergence}} \label{sec:conv}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 \fg{Figure~\ref{fig:eb-res} shows magnetic energy as a function of time for
 models with $\eta = 10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$, as well as a direct comparison of
 our technique to \BKM. We find that numerical diffusion still dominates at
 these resolutions for the lower resistivity, as can be seen from the
 increasing speed of the SSD with resolution, but that a converged SSD solution
 emerges at the higher value for parsec resolution.}
 Saturation at around 5\% of $\overline{e_K}$ appears to be a well-converged
 result.
 \fg{The $\eta = 10^{-3}$ models show} false convergence
 \citep{FMA91} of solutions with similar magnetic energy decay at $\dx\geq2$.
 \fg{We note that strong fluctuations in the characteristics of the flow
 \fg{occur at the} low $\dot\sigma$ \fg{that we choose to avoid thermal runaway
 \citep{LOCBN15},} with thermal phases occupying changing fractional volumes
 \citep[e.g.][]{gatto2015} and hosting SSD instabilities with different 
 thresholds and growth rates.
 %FAG: is it not worth commenting that the changed in growth/decay are 
 %FAG: concurrent across models at high res?
 % mm There is convergence in the occurrence of sporadic slowing and acceleration
 % of the dynamo for $\dx\lesssim1$ and between $\eta=10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$,
 % occurring near $t=20$ and 40\,Myr.
 }

 \fg{\BKM\ chose a higher $\dot\sigma$ than the low value we choose for our
 fiducial runs} \fg{to preserve multiphase \fg{thermal} structure in \fg{our}
 \fg{periodic} numerical domain.
 \fg{We did run direct comparisons at varying resolution to \BKM\
 (Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-res}\,(c))} using $\dot\sigma=8\SNr$.
 \fg{This high $\dot\sigma$ rapidly drives thermal runaway resulting in high
 temperatures $T>10^7$\,K.}
 The growth rate is faster \fg{than in our fiducial models}, reflective of the
 single phase kinematics and more persistent forcing rate, yet \fg{still}
 saturating at about 5\% of $\overline{e_K}$.
 \fg{At equivalent resolution, the sixth-order Pencil Code has lower diffusion
 than the second-order Godunov code used by \BKM. As a result, we find faster
 growth at equivalent resolution; we} include a lower resolution run \fg{that}
 demonstrate\fg{s} consistency with \BKM.} 

 \fg{We can also examine the properties of the flow and magnetic field through
 their energy spectra (Figure~\ref{fig:3power}).
 The kinetic spectra (a--c right panels) for $\dx\leq1$ agree well at 
 all scales above the viscous cutoff, which appears, as expected, at lower $k$ for
 $\dx=1$ than $\dx=0.5$.
 By contrast the kinetic spectra for $\dx\geq2$ differ and exhibit significant
 energy losses at all scales,    
 indicating only solutions for $\dx\lesssim1$ have converged.}

 \fg{The addition of viscosity $\nu=10^{-3}$, indicated by the magenta curves in
 panels (b) and (c), \fg{makes little difference to the shape of the
   magnetic or kinetic energy spectra.  The magnitude of the magnetic
   energy spectrum increases somewhat with the addition of viscosity,
   as can also be seen from comparing dotted light and dark blue
   lines in Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-nu}\,(a2).}
   }

 \fg{We have shown that SSD turbulence \fg{converges} for $\dx\leq1$.
 Underresolving SN driven turbulence results in a significant loss of energy
 at all scales. \fg{The}
 SSD for $0.2\SNr\leq \dot\sigma \leq 8\SNr$ saturates in the ISM at about
 $5\%\overline{e_K}$ and grows more rapidly with increasing SN rate.

\subsection{\fg{Effective resistivity and Prandtl number}} \label{sec:eta}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 \fg{To understand the role of {physical} {resistivity} $\eta$
   and {viscosity} $\nu$ on the
   SSD,
 we need to determine the value at each resolution where they
   exceed numerical diffusion in strength.}
 Figure~\ref{fig:eb-nu} shows that
 \fg{a physical resistivity of $\eta=10^{-5}$ makes no impact on field
   growth at $\dot\sigma = 0.2 \SNr$, while $\eta=10^{-3}$ clearly
   dominates over numerical resistivity at all resolutions.  The exact
   value of the minimum physical resistivity does seem to vary not
   just with $\dx$ but also with $\sigma$, as can be seen by
   comparison of the $\eta=10^{-4}$ and $10^{-5}$ cases. 
 }

 \fg{When we consider $e_B$ for the models {with} only numerical
 viscosity
 (Fig\,\ref{fig:eb-nu} a, c, d), $\eta\geq10^{-3}$ initially appears
 sufficient to suppress SSD.
 At low resolution this remains so for $\dot\sigma=0.2\SNr$ (panels c1 and d1),
 apart from a transitory surge near 100\,Myr for $\dx=2$.
 However, for $\dot\sigma=\SNr$ within 100\,Myr SSD is evident.
 Only, $\eta=0.005$ dampens SSD (panel d2).}
 The mean sonic Mach number $\overline\Ms=0.8$ for $\dot\sigma=\SNr$, compared
 to $0.5$ for $0.2\SNr$.
 A higher $\Ms$ has been demonstrated to impede an SSD in isothermal turbulence
 \citep{Haugen:2004M}, which is contradicted here.

 \fg{The kinetic energy spectra in Figure\,\ref{fig:3power}} may
 show the resolution of this contradiction.
 They display a bottleneck effect \citep{Falkovich94,HBD03}, an energy cascade
 less efficient than $k^{-5/3}$
 leading to an accumulation of power and then rapid dissipation at high $k$.
 This bottleneck shifts to lower $k$ as $\dx$
 \fg{(panels a--c) and $\dot\sigma$ increase (panel d).}
 \fg{The deeper into the magnetic energy spectrum this peak extends, the more 
 scales available for transfer to magnetic energy and the more
 efficient the SSD.
 The critical resistivity above which SSD is suppressed, therefore, 
 increases with $\dot\sigma$, within the range considered. 
 Even at $\dot\sigma=0.2$, for $\eta=10^{-3}$ and $\dx\leq1$ SSD occurs after
 20 -- 40\,Myr.}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 \fg{Resistivity contributes to Rm, which is expected to control the onset
 of the SSD and affect growth rate.
 We therefore anticipate that lower $\eta$ would correlate with higher growth
 rate \citep{Sch07}.
 This mainly is the case when we compare models with $\dx\leq1$ at 
 concurrent stages in their evolution.
 However, in Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-nu}\,(c2) there are some anomolous patterns, 
 where higher $\eta$ models overtake lower $\eta$ models, e.g., at 80\,Myr.
 To explore this further we include experiments with $\dx=1$ and $\nu>0$, and
 examine the effect of Pm on the SSD (Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-nu}\,b1, b2).
 We identify each model by $\Pm=\nu/\eta$, but due to the inclusion of 
 shock and hyper diffusivities, the effective Pm and, indeed, Rm vary 
 substantially across space and time.}

 \fg{Plotted in panel b2, where we fix $\eta=10^{-4}$ and vary $\nu$,
 initial growth of $e_B$ is faster for 
 $\Pm=0.1$ than for higher values.}
 This is a regime {\em less} conducive to exciting the SSD than the high $\Pm$
 regime typical of the ISM \citep{HBD04}.
 \fg{A plausible explanation may be that the higher fluid Reynolds number, Re,
 could facilitate the dynamo.
 We therefore set a physical viscosity $\nu=10^{-3}$ and vary $\eta$. 
 Plotted in panel (b1) the growth rates mainly
 conform to our expectations, except for $\Pm=5$ between 20 and 40\,Myr.
 We confirm that $\eta\geq10^{-2.3}$ suppresses SSD at $\dot\sigma=0.2\SNr$.
 While the saturation level is insensitive to Pm, with $\nu$ fixed (panel
 b2), the saturation level increases with Pm for $\eta$ fixed (panel b1),
 indicating saturation level is sensitive to Re.
 We also include two of these plots in panel (a2) for comparison to $\nu=0$.
 Comparing the kinetic energy spectra (magenta) models in 
 Figure\,\ref{fig:3power}\,(b2, c2), $\nu$ alters very little.}
 
 \fg{We have shown that the critical resistivity for SSD in the ISM with a
 low SN rate is $10^{-2.3}>\eta_{\rm crit}>10^{-3}$ and
 that this increases with increasing
 $\dot\sigma$ within the range considered.
 Although higher Rm and Pm generally increase growth rate
 and saturation
 in line with theoretical expectations,
 there is considerable variation, likely due to intermittency in
   the multiphase ISM.}

\subsection{\fg{Tangling of the imposed field}} \label{sec:Balsara}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% mm [introduce question to be studied in this section]
\mm{We now examine whether the field growth seen in our models could
  be due to field tangling.  In Sect.~\ref{sec:ssd-tang} we argued
  based on our isothermal models that tangling should produce linear
  growth rate and that only a direct
  Kazantsev cascade should occur, with dissipation dominating scales
  below the forcing range. Conversely, an SSD leads to exponential
  growth and an inverse Kazantsev cascade extending below the forcing scale.}

 SN-driven turbulence does not have a \mm{single} forcing scale, unlike the
 simplified model in Section\,\ref{sec:ssd-tang}, because of the
 heterogeneous ISM structure and random explosion locations.
 \mm{Instead, the} forcing scale \mm{is} distributed at scales
 \fg{of roughly 60--200~pc
   \citep{joung2006,avillez2007,HSSFG17}, or $k \sim 30$--105~kpc$^{-1}$}.

 % mm [I have tried to rewrite this section to focus more on results
 % rather than description.  Please check to see if it is correct]
\mm{In Figures~\ref{fig:3power} and~\ref{fig:4power} we indeed demonstrate
strong exponential growth over multiple orders of magnitude so long as
the resistivity remains low enough, despite variation in supernova
rate $\dot\sigma$, numerical resolution $\dx$, and physical viscosity
$\nu$. Linear growth only appears to occur in models with high
physical resistivity.}

\mm{We now turn to the power spectra. Figure\,\ref{fig:4power} shows
  compensated spectra over time during a period that }
 %mm Figure\,\ref{fig:4power}\,(a) shows the evolving compensated spectra for  $\dx=0.5$ between \fg{12} and 32\,Myr\fg{, and (b) for a comparison model to \BKM\ at $\dx=0.78$ between 4 and 21\,Myr.}

% mostly to $k\fg{\simeq1200}\kpc^{-1}$ (a2) or
% $k\fg{\simeq1000}\kpc^{-1}$ (b).
  
The compensated magnetic energy spectra in Figure\,\ref{fig:4power}\,(a1, b1)
 have \fg{peaks conforming to the end of the Kazantsev range.
 For $\fg{\dot\sigma=0.2\SNr}$ up to 14\,Myr this peak is at
 $k\fg{\simeq200}\kpc^{-1}$ while the
 SSD grows \mm{slowly}.
 During accelerated growth the Kazentsev range extends to}
 $k\gtrsim\fg{700}\kpc^{-1}$, above the forcing scale and consistent
 with SSD \mm{as shown in the uniform, isothermal model}
 (Fig.\,\ref{fig:tangling}b).
 The peak contracts upon saturation to $k<\fg{200}\kpc^{-1}$, consistent with no
 \mm{further} dynamo (Fig.\,\ref{fig:tangling}c).
 In Figure\,\ref{fig:4power}\,(b1) \fg{until 7\,Myr there is no Kazantsev range
 and the peak energy increases as $k\rightarrow0$, a signature of tangling of
 the imposed field
 %mm , similar to Figure\,\ref{fig:tangling}\,(c) (see also  \mm{dark
 %green dashed}
 %curve Figure\,\ref{fig:3power}\,d). 
 However, as the magnetic field grows much larger than the imposed field,
 this signature disappears and the peak shifts to high $k$.}
 
 \fg{We have demonstrated that the magnetic field amplification in \BKM\ is
 due to SSD. 
 Tangling of the imposed field is \mm{initially} present, but is
 % mm limited to within an order of magnitude. The amplification is
 dominated by SSD. \mm{O}ur other models 
 confirm an imposed field is not required.
 }

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}

 \fg{Through the most extensive resolution and parameter study to date, we
   demonstrate in this letter that SSD
   % mm is likely very easily excited
\mm{likely occurs easily}
 in the ISM.
 The critical resistivity is $0.005>\eta_{\rm crit}\gtrsim0.001\kpc\kms$ for 
 supernova rate $\dot \sigma=0.2\SNr$ and increasing over the 
 range considered $\dot \sigma\in(0.2\SNr,8\SNr)$.
 \mm{The} SSD
 % mm in the ISM
 saturates at about 5\% of the equiparti\mm{ti}on kinetic energy
 density.
 This level is insensitive to Pm, but \mm{increases} with increasing Re.}
 We find that the conventional approach from dynamo theory of categorising the 
 turbulence according to Rm based on a forcing scale $\ell$, mean random
 velocity $u_{\rm rms}$ and resistivity $\eta$ is inadequate for such a
 complicated system.

 We show that simulations with insufficient resolution can appear to
 converge to a false solution lacking dynamo activity
 (Fig.\,\ref{fig:eb-res}b). This can occur because these simulations are not

 %In this Letter we demonstrate, without the use of an imposed magnetic field,
 %that the field amplification demonstrated by \citet{BKMM04} was evidence of
 %an SSD in SN-driven ISM turbulence and not just caused by tangling of their
 %imposed field.
 %Through the most extensive resolution and parameter study to date, we show
 %that SN-driven turbulence easily excites an SSD even at SN rates well below the
 %Galactic value.
 %Our conclusion is supported by noting that the resistivity of the ISM is far
 %smaller than we can resolve numerically, so the ISM is far more susceptible to
 %dynamo action than our models.
 %Our models with $\dx=0.5$ and $1\pc$ with $\eta=10^{-3}\kpc\kms$ show that a
 %seed field of less than 1~nG can be amplified to saturation at microgauss
 %levels within about 10\,Myr (Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-res}). 
 %Unlike isothermal turbulence high Mach numbers do not necessarily impede SSD
 %in the ISM with increasing SN forcing.

 %We further show that simulations with insufficient resolution can appear to
 %converge to a false solution lacking dynamo activity
 %(Figure\,\ref{fig:eb-res}b). This can occur because these simulations are not
 %scale independent. 
 %The SN energy input and the physically motivated ISM cooling processes impose
 %length and time scales that must be adequately resolved.
 %To reach true convergence requires resolution of $1\pc$ or better.
 %In our models, resolutions $\dx\geq2\pc$ not only give an incorrect dynamo
 %solution, but also exhibit significant kinetic energy losses due to excess
 %dissipation.
 %This also affects the energy spectrum at the largest scales, so should be 
 %considered when interpreting results using adaptive mesh refinement.
 %We do, however find the well-converged result at all resolutions that when an
 %SSD is excited it saturates at about 5\% of the energy equipartition level.
 %At low resolution this is a lower bound, because the time-averaged kinetic
 %energy density is understated, due to dissipative losses.
 %This might account for the discrepancy between the energy density of the mean
 %magnetic field and the random magnetic field in \citet{Gent:2013b}, due to the
 %LSD being well resolved while the SSD remained underresolved.

 %We find that the conventional approach from dynamo theory of categorising the 
 %turbulence according to Rm based on a forcing scale $\ell$, mean random velocity
 %$u_{\rm rms}$ and resistivity $\eta$ is inadequate for such a complicated
 %system.
 %We will show in upcoming work that the ISM appears to have multiple regimes
 %with thermal phases occupying changing fractional volumes
 %\citep[e.g.][]{gatto2015} and hosting SSD instabilities with different
 %thresholds and growth rates.
 %Explaining the interaction of these SSDs will require more sophisticated
 %statistical and perhaps toplogical techniques, in advance of being able to 
 %address how such an SSD interacts with an LSD.

 %FAG: trim
 %With grid resolution $\dx\geq2\pc$, an SSD in SN-driven turbulence simulations
 %can be excluded with $\eta\gtrsim10^{-3}\kpc\kms$.
 %In \citet{Gressel:2008} and \citet{GE20}, $\dx$ is 8.3 and $6.7\pc$,
 %respectively and $\eta\simeq6.5\cdot10^{-3}\kpc\kms$, which appears to exclude
 %an SSD.
 %\citet{Gent:2013b} applied $\eta\simeq8\cdot10^{-4}\kpc\kms$ with $\dx=4\pc$,
 %which would support SSD with SN rates similar to the solar neighbourhood.
 %The latter obtain an LSD with galactic angular momentum $\Omega=\OSN$, where
 %$\OSN=25\kms\kpc^{-1}$ is the rate in the solar neighbourhood.
 %The former require $\Omega\geq4\OSN$ to excite an LSD.
 %The value of Rm at the largest scales would be 7.5 times higher for the latter
 %model, which alone can explain the LSD at lower $\Omega$.
 %Early efforts by \citet{Korpi:1999b} were unable to detect even LSD.
 %With a resolution even less than \citet{Gressel:2008} $\Omega\gg\OSN$ would
 %be required to excite LSD, and SSD would be ruled out.
 \citet{Gressel:2008} and \citet{GE20} have $\dx=8.3$ and $6.7\pc$,
 respectively, and $\eta\simeq10^{-2.2}\kpc\kms$, which appears to exclude
 an SSD.
 \citet{Gent:2013a} with $\dx=4\pc$ applied $\eta\simeq10^{-3.1}\kpc\kms$,
 which would support SSD for $\dot\sigma\simeq\SNr$.
 %mm [While true, I don't see this LSD discussion as relevant to this Letter.  Do you
 %all disagree?]
% The latter obtain an LSD with galactic angular momentum $\Omega=\OSN$, where
% $\OSN=25\kms\kpc^{-1}$ is the rate in the solar neighbourhood.
% The former require $\Omega\gtrsim4\OSN$ to excite an LSD.
% Early efforts by \citet{Korpi:1999b} were unable to detect even LSD.
 \fg{We can now construct LSD experiments to explore how SSD impacts the 
onset of LSD, critical $\Omega$, and dependence on $\dot\sigma$%mm for
% LSD.

 %A commonly used expression for Rm is 
 %\begin{equation}\label{eq:sRm}
 %\Rm=\frac{\ell {u_{\rm rms}}}{\eta},
 %\end{equation}
 %where $\ell = 2 \pi/\kf$ is the forcing scale.
 %However, the inhomogeneity of the turbulence and changing multiphase
 %composition of the ISM render defining a single forcing scale or rms velocity
 %unreliable.
 %We, therefore, consider computing Rm at each grid point directly from the
 %ratio of advective to diffusive terms in the induction equation
 %%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 %\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:Rm}
 %  \Rm = \frac{\left|\vect{u}\times\vect{B}\right|}{
 %    \left|\eta\vect\nabla^2\vect{A}+\eta_3\vect\nabla^6\vect{A}\right|}.
 %\end{eqnarray}
 %%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 %Using averaged values (eq.~[\ref{eq:sRm}]), 
 %$\Rm = 1.5 \cdot 10^4$, for $\eta=10^{-4}$, $\ell=50\pc$ and
 %${u_{\rm rms}}=30\kms$.
 %With the local definition (eq.~[\ref{eq:Rm}]) in the model with 
 %$\dx=0.5\pc$ and $\eta=10^{-4}$ at 20\,Myr we find
 %$\Rm\in(1.0\cdot10^{-4},5.8\cdot 10^3)$,
 %and mean value $\langle\Rm\rangle=4.1\pm5.7$.
 %Thus, the mean Rm appears unhelpful:
 %in the ISM some phases and regions may exceed the critical Rm for an
 %SSD while others do not.
 %Microscopic resistivity is temperature dependent \citep{CSR50}.
 %Even considering only turbulent resistivity to have relevance, 
 %typical length scales and rms velocities differ between phases.
 %Therefore, we use the explicitly chosen resistivity $\eta$ to discriminate
 %between models rather than Rm.

 %We have set $\nu=0$ and $\nu_3=\eta_3$ sufficient to numerically resolve the
 %grid scale.
 %The magnetic Prandtl number $\Pm = \Rm/\Rey$, and like $\Rm$ we have
 %$\Pm\in(4.2\cdot10^{-6},4.8\cdot10^{4})$, due to inclusion of shock capturing
 %viscosity and differences in definition of hyperviscosity and hyperresistivity.
 %Hence, some part of each simulation will be characterised by high Pm,
 %but $\langle\Pm\rangle<1$.
 %%FAG: merged this with section 4.2
 %This is a regime less conducive to exciting the SSD than the high $\Pm$ regime
 %typical of the ISM \citep{HBD04}.
 %In separate experiments with $\nu>\eta$ (high Pm), which we shall describe in
 %future work, we do in fact see increased growth rates for lower $\eta$, as
 %expected \citep{Sch07}.

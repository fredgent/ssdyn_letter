\begin{abstract}
We present a numerical resolution study over a range of magnetic Reynolds
number (Rm) to identify characteristics of the small-scale dynamo (SSD) under
supernova-driven turbulence of the interstellar medium (ISM).
We confirm that conditions in the ISM are likely highly conducive to 
SSD in the diffuse hot and warm turbulent ISM, given Rm in the real ISM is 
orders of magnitude higher than we model at our highest resolution and modest
SN explosion frequency ($\SNr$), 20\% that of the solar neighbourhood.
This is despite the negative impact on SSD expected from the highly compressible
nature of the flow.
We find convergence in the growth rate of the SSD with resolution for a given 
$\SNr$ approaching 
sub-parsec scale and a trend towards the exclusion of SSD for resolution
more coarse than 4 parsecs.
Across the modelled range of 0.5 to 4 parsec resolution we find the SSD 
saturates consistently at about 5\% of the energy equipartion level, independent
of the growth rate.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}


To be revised \ldots

This letter addresses the recent results of \citet{GE20}, which asserts the 
absence of a small scale (fluctuation) dynamo (SSD) in the interstellar medium
(ISM) subject to supernova induced turbulence and multi-phase structure
applicable to the solar neighbourhood. 
They refute the earlier dynamo solutions of \citet{BKMM04}

\end{figure*}

In many simulations of supernova driven turbulence with realistic vertical 
stratification \citep[e.g.,][]{deAvillez:2005,PO07,Hill:2012a,HI14} the mechaniisms
for inducing large scale magnetic fields are absent, such as rotation and shear.
To examine the effect of strong ordered magnetic fields these models then rely
on imposition a background or initial magnetic field, typically uniform,
which is then perturbed by supernova explosions.
The amplification of the magnetic field in these cases may include a small
scale dynamo in case of sufficently high magnetic Reynolds numbers, but any
amplification of the large scale field is limited to linear growth through
tangling of the imposed field.
Any initial large scale field would diffuse leaving only the random field. 
If an imposed field is sufficiently close to equipartition its characteristics
would dominate any MHD results.

More commonly models of supernova driven dynamo in the ISM have ignored the 
large scale effects and examined the small scale dynamo or the effect of the
turbulent magnetic field on the properties of the ISM
\citep[e.g.,][]{BKMM04,BalKim05,MacLow:2005}.
A seed or imposed field for such models could be uniform or random, but if the
simulated field results from tangling rather than dynamo, then any conclusions
about the ISM depend on the veracity of the chosen field rather than the 
nature of the MHD turbulence.

To illustrate some differences between tangling and small scale dynamo we adopt
a toy model with non-helical random forcing with wavenumber $\kf=8$ applied to
isothermal uniform density in $256^3$ $2\pi$-periodic boxes.
A uniform field with energy density $e_B\simeq6\cdot10^{-22}\overline{e_K}$ is imposed, where $\overline{e_K}$ is the time-averaged kinetic energy density.
The two simulations are distinguished only by use of $\eta=10^{-4}$, exciting a 
small scale dynamo models, and $\eta=2\cdot10^{-3}$ subcritical for dynamo.
Our numerical implementations use the {\sc Pencil Code}\footnote{
\url{https://github.com/pencil-code}}.

We plot some of the diagnostics from the results of these two simulations in 
Figure\,\ref{fig:tangling}.
Panel (a) illustrates that the small scale dynamo 
is characterised by exponential growth \fag{Nishant, please add some relevant citation to this expected behaviour}, growing over 10 orders of magnitude in 
just over 400 eddy turnover times.
Tangling results only in linear amplification
early on (see inset), saturating within 100 eddy turnover times at below 5 times
the imposed field energy density.

In panel (b) we plot for the SSD model some power spectra for the magnetic
energy, evolving over time alongside a kinetic energy spectrum at late stage.
The magnetic energy spectra are compensated by $k^{-3/2}$ and kinetic by
$k^{5/3}$.
A profile becoming horizontal, therefore, corresponds to the Kazentsev 
\fag{Anyone, a suitable reference for this expected behaviour?} $3/2$ inverse
cascade power law or Kolmogorov turbulent energy cascade.
In panel (c) see we show similar for the tangling model.
The forcing scale $\kf=8$ is evident in the kinetic spectra and highlighted by 
a vertical dotted line.
The SSD magnetic spectrum (b) evolves near self-similarly, with an 
uncompensated peak
wavenumber above 20 at early times reducing to below 20 upon saturation of the
dynamo.
The forcing scale has negligible effect on the magnetic spectra.
However, for the tangling case (c) the peak wavenumber for the magnetic energy
spectrum is strongly identified with the forcing scale.
The Kazentsev range of the spectrum extends to wavenumbers larger than the 
forcing scale for SSD, while confined to larger scales for the field with
tangling only. 

Given the high magnetic Prandtl numbers, the magnetic spectra retain more energy
at smaller scales than the kinetic spectra.
Although the kinetic parameters are identical and are subject to the same 
viscous cutoff, the SSD extends the kinetic energy into the larger scales
due to the feedback from the Lorentz force.
With SSD there is a short inertial range for $10\leq k/k_1\lesssim 15$.
Thus, in the dynamo kinetic energy deposited along the Kolmogorov range to
smaller scales transfers energy to the magnetic field at these scales
inducing an inverse Kazentsev range begining at scales below the forcing
scale, while with tangling the energy tranfers to the magnetic field
only at scales between the forcing scale and scale of the imposed field.
There is only dissipation of the field at scales smaller than the Kazentsev 
range.


\section{SN turbulence model design} \label{sec:model}

While in the SN experiments considered in this letter are restricted to
SSD, some large scale models do include the large scale dynamo
\citep[e.g.,][]{Gressel:2008,HWK09,WA09,Gent:2013b,EGSFB16,Pakmor17,GE20}.
Most of these do not include a small scale dynamo.
\citet{Gent:2013b,EGSFB16} do include SSD, but without a clear understanding of
the characteristics of this SSD it is difficult to explore the effect this has
on the large scale dynamo (LSD) and the properties of the ISM.
In this letter we explore the SSD in realistic simulations of SN driven 
turbulence.
The resolution and parameter study is intended to identify the critical ranges
for excitation of SSD and understand dynamo growth rates and saturation 
conditions.
This will also identify the prerequisites for including or excluding SSD in the
LSD models and subsequently establish the importance of SSD-LSD interactions 
on galaxy dynamics. 


To exclude any large scale magnetic field dynamics in these simulations, the
computational domain occupies a cube of length 120 pc, with periodic boundaries
on all sides. 
We solve the system of non-ideal compressible MHD equations, including 
mass Eq\,\eqref{eq:mass}, momentum Eq\,\eqref{eq:mom}, energy Eq\,\eqref{eq:ent} and
induction Eq.\,\eqref{eq:ind}:
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  \begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:mass}
  \frac{D\rho}{Dt} &=& - \vect\nabla \cdot (\rho \vect{u}) + \vect\nabla \cdot\zeta_D\vect\nabla\rho,\\
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  \label{eq:mom}
  \rho\frac{D\vect{u}}{Dt} &=& \vect\nabla{\ESK\sigma}
    -\rho c_{\rm s}^2\vect\nabla\left({s}/{c_{\rm p}}+\ln\rho\right)
    +\vect{j}\times\vect{B}\nonumber\\
    &+&\vect\nabla\cdot \left(2\rho\nu{\mathbfss W}\right)+
       \rho\,\zeta_{\nu}\left(\vect\nabla\vect\nabla \cdot \vect{u} \right)\nonumber\\
    & 
     +&
       \vect\nabla\cdot \left(2\rho\nu_3{\mathbfss W}^{(3)}\right),\\
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  \label{eq:ent}
  \rho T\frac{D s}{Dt} &=& \EST\dot\sigma +\rho\Gamma -\rho^2\Lambda +\eta\mu_0\vect{j}^2 
     +2 \rho \nu\left|{\mathbfss W}\right|^{2}
   \nonumber\\
  &+&\vect\nabla\cdot\left(\zeta_\chi\rho T\vect\nabla s\right)
  + 
  \rho T\chi_3\vect\nabla^6 s,\\
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  \label{eq:ind}
    \frac{\partial \vect{A}}{\partial t} &=&
        \vect{u}\times\vect{B}
      + \eta\vect\nabla^2\vect{A}
       +\eta_3\vect\nabla^6\vect{A},
  \end{eqnarray}
completing the system with the equation of state for an ideal gas.
Many symbols have their usual meaning, and a table is included in the appendix
for clarity.
In particular, terms containing $\zeta_D,\,\zeta_\nu$ and $\zeta_\eta$ are the
application of artificial diffusion acting proportional to shocks in 
Eqs.\,\eqref{eq:mass},\,\eqref{eq:mom} and \eqref{eq:ent}, respectively.
This machinery is described in detail in \citet{GMKSH20}, which is included to
resolve shock discontinuities.
Shock diffusion is not applied to Eq.\,\eqref{eq:ind}, where it would result in 
unphysical dissipation of the magnetic field in the shock fronts, when in fact 
here it is highly enhanced by compression.
In Eqs.\,\eqref{eq:mom} -- \eqref{eq:ind}, expressions containing 
$\nu_3,\,\chi_3$ and $\eta_3$ apply sixth-order hyperdiffusion applying primarily
at the grid scale to resolve small-scale instabilities.
\fag{add reference re hyper3}

The supernovae are injected randomly uniform in 3D space and as a
Poisson process proportional to the solar neigbourhood rate in the Milky Way,
 $\SNr\simeq 50$\,kpc$^{-3}$\,Myr$^{-1}$. 
Each explosion injects energy $\ESN=10^{51}$\,erg as thermal energy, $\EST$, but in 
dense media a small proportion may be in kinetic energy, $\ESK$.
This is described in detail by \citet{GMKSH20}.
Non-adiabatic heating, $\Gamma$, and cooling, $\Lambda$, processes are included
following \citet{Wolfire:1995} and \citet{Sarazin:1987}, as described in 
\citet{Gent:2013a}. 

In the subset of experiments presented in this letter we set viscosity, $\nu=0$,
with $\nu_3$ applying optimally for each resolution to ensure the flow is 
well resolved.
We establish a benchmark for the magnetic field evolution setting $\eta=0$, with
numerical resistivity acting via the optimal setting for $\eta_3$.
We then vary $\eta\geq10^{-6}$ to identify minimal range for which the physical
resistivity is dynamically dominating the numerical resistivity, and examine the
dependence of the dynamo on $\nu$ and grid resolution. 
In contrast to our earlier experiments \citep{Gent:2013a,Gent:2013b,GMKSH20},
we do not include thermal diffusivity, $\chi$, in these experiments as 
the artificial diffusivities are adequate to ensure numerical stability and
the physical effects of thermal conductivity can be expected to be relevant only
at time and spatial scales much shorter than considered here.

\caption{
Compensated energy spectra at times in Myr given in the captions for 
0.5\,pc resolution.
Rm is super critical for dynamo applying $\eta=10^{-4}$ in
panels (a) and (b) and sub critical or marginal for dynamo applying
$\eta=10^{-3}$ in panels (c) and (d).
Energy spectra are compensated against theoretical profiles of Kazentsev
$k^{3/2}$, (a) and (c), and Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$, (b) and (d), 
each represented by the horizontal black dashed lines.

We are somewhat disappointed by the slow convergence of opinions with the
referee. Our intention, which should also be very clear from the main text
itself, is *not* to claim that Pencil Code is the *optimal* tool for such
modelling, but we have, in length, demonstrated in earlier publications that it
is a *valid* and efficient tool for such modelling. The intention of the letter
is to present novel and high-impact results from the simulations, rather than
present or advertise the code itself. Our aim is to present the model and
simulations to the extent that the paper can be read stand alone from the
earlier publication presenting the model in detail, but still contain the
essential parts for understanding the core concepts. We feel that the referee's
statements of "obscure" and "mysterious" in criticising our model description
are inappropriate, but yet we still have tried to improve on those descriptions
to appease the referee.

%MJK We should try to make the descriptions clearer, and explain here what we have changed.
%FAG
Shock handling is typically applied only to the momentum equation, but due to the
additional challenges involved with the application of cooling and the extreme
energetics invoked by SN forcing, we have extended this machinery to the continuity
and energy equations. It is desirable to minimise the use of this machinery and we
have demonstrated in Gent et al 2020 that this enables the Pencil Code to model
these shock waves to high accuracy. In practice it is not required for the induction
equation to resolve the magnetic field in the shocks, so it is not applied. The 
coefficients for hyper diffusion impose a mesh Reynolds number of 1, so vary with
resolution. We have clarified this in the text. The hyper diffusion suppresses 
high frequency numerical instabilities from growing, ensuring the fluctuations in
the physical variables arise from the resolved physical processes sufficiently
above the grid scale. This is distinct from the large scale physical feature of 
a blast wave, which needs to be resolved within a minimal range of grid spaces 
as it travels. Shocks are not resolved nor suppressed by the hyper diffusion.

%MJK Here, the referee has already decided that the kinetic energy is not a
%constant - crazy. I suggest we proceed as planned: to show the kinetic energy
%in an additional panel to Figure 2, and possibly add the Mach number from the
%sims with a different axis on the right hand side.
%FAG
We have an additional panel to Figure 2 showing the evolving kinetic energy 
density and the rms sonic Mach number for higher resolution runs with alternate
SN rates. The models are in HD statistical steady state, the variance lower
with increased SN rate. This has a physical explanation, in that the more 
sporadic forcing with lower SN rate induces higher intermittency in the 
energetics. The sonic Mach number is of order unity during the kinematic phase
of the SSD, reducing more rapidly with higher resolution, where the fractional
volume of the cooler phases can be resolved in smaller filaments, and with
higher SN rate, where the fractional volume and mean temperature of the hot gas
is higher. During the kinematic phase the high SN models have M_s>1 and faster
SSD, while the saturation corresponds with M_s reducing below 1 upon saturation.
The slower SSD for low SN rate occurs with M_s near 1, and M_s again reduces 
after the kinematic phase. The numbers for M_s in the text refer to dx=2. 
The apparent contrast with the previous isothermal models, is that the increased
forcing also results in higher energetics, which likely compensate the effect
of high Mach numbers. We have revised the comments about the Mach number and
moved it to the discussion of Figure 2.

%MJK Here we also had a clear plan of action, and I suggest we follow it.
%FAG
We have replaced the plots in Figure 4 with a log-linear scale as suggested. In
Figure 2 we have retained the log-log scales for panels (a) and (b), where we 
wish to illustrate the convergence with resolution. These models are also
included in Figure 4. Figure 2 (c) has been replaced with log-linear, as they
evolve over comparable timescales. The exponential growth is more clearly 
demonstrated for our models than either of the Balsara models. This supports
our assertion that the increased accuracy of the Pencil Code, alongside its
shock handling tools, make is well suited for modelling this environment,
even without the more exact shock treatment available to Balsara et al. 
In Figure 4 the exponential nature of the growth is now clearly evident.
Where growth rates do vary, each phase has a straight line, confirming 
exponential behaviour, and overall growth for each curve can also adequately
be fitted with a straight line.

  The ratio (n_max/n_min)^(2/3) in the domain is at most 4.7e4 at dx=0.5
  and 4.7e3 dx=4. 
  The mean of n^(4/3) fluctuates around 1.6 between 1.4 and 1.8, independent
  of resolution.
  Compression does not adequately explain the field amplification.

%MJK Here to explain that the initial seed field is already so small, that
%reducing it further below the floating point accuracy is not necessary. And
%why does he say "like in section 2"? Anyways, it sounds like for this referee
%the main problem is still the lack of exponential growth, which we have
%obviously failed to demonstrate to him convincingly. I feel it is important to
%make the Balsara comparison plot as convincing as possible.
%FAG
The referee may have misunderstood the specification of the seed field. Only in 
our models with SN rate 8x and resolution chosen to match Balsara et al, do we
use a strong seed field. Even here the magnetic energy is amplified by 4 orders
of magnitude, so we clearly have the kinematic SSD (Fig 2c and Fig 5b).
Otherwise all models apply a unifrom random seed field of mean strength 1nG,
which initially decays further. The magnetic energy is at least 8 orders of
magnitude weaker than the kinetic energy before the SSD begins to evolve. The
SSD therefore amplifies the magnetic energy over six orders of magnitude as
evident in all panels of Figure 4, so the kinematic phase is properly 
explored.

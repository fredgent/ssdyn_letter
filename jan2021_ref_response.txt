Dear Editor,

We believe that the reviewer has neglected to sufficiently consider
the material presented in our previous publication on resolution of
strong shocks with the Pencil code (Gent et al. 2020), as well as the
extensive literature on the advantages of the use of the Pencil Code
in dynamo modeling going back to Brandenburg & Sarson (2002) and
Haugen & Brandenburg (2004).  As this is a Letter, we cannot include
all that material in the current paper, but can only summarize and
reference. We do address the referee's specific concerns below.

The substantial advantage of using a high-order advection algorithm, even at
the cost of relying on artificial diffusivity for shock capturing, is clearly
demonstrated in the comparison shown in Figure 2c, where we reproduce the
results of a second-order code with a Riemann solver (Balsara et al. 2004)
using grid resolution a full factor of two coarser.

To the general question of how shocks should be resolved, approximate Riemann
solvers indeed provide good shock solutions, but are difficult to couple to
high-order advection algorithms.  The historical alternative is to use some
form of von Neumann & Richtmyer (1950, J. Appl. Phys.) artificial viscosity,
which of course was the original method used to resolve shocks numerically, by
spreading them out sufficiently for them to be modeled using the standard
advection algorithm.  The original von Neumann & Richtmyer algorithm only adds
diffusivity proportional to the square of the negative divergence to the
momentum and energy equation in order to ensure conservation across shocks.
The sixth-order Pencil code does require a small amount of mass divergence as
well in order to ensure numerical stability when wall heating occurs from the
interaction of strong shocks, but that is not a particularly desirable aspect
of the algorithm, and certainly not one we would want to extend to further 
conservation equations. Although addition of numerical resistivity at shocks was used
in the older paper by Gent et al. (2013), that leads to unphysical loss of flux
at the shock front, and provides no improvement in numerical stability, so
abandoning its use, as was done in Gent et al. (2020), improves the solution
rather than harming it, as well as returning to an algorithm that better
resembles the successful traditional formulation of artificial viscosity.

We are puzzled why grid-scale numerical instability would be seen as
crucial for shocks.  What is crucial for shocks is to conserve mass,
momentum, energy, and flux across as thin a discontinuity as possible.  The
need for hyperdiffusion occurs because the sixth-order advection
formulation provides extremely low numerical diffusion, unlike typical
lower-order algorithms, so some grid scale diffusion must be provided
artificially.  The hyperdiffusion suppresses high frequency numerical
instabilities from growing, while adding infinitesimal amounts of diffusion
at resolved scales. This ensures that fluctuations in the physical
variables arise from resolved physical processes sufficiently
above the grid scale. These numerical instabilities are quite distinct 
from the large-scale physical feature of a blast wave, which needs to be 
resolved across a minimal number of grid zones. Shocks are neither resolved nor
suppressed by the hyperdiffusion.  The coefficients for hyperdiffusion 
are chosen to impose a grid-scale Reynolds number of roughly unity, so they must
vary with resolution. We have clarified this in the text by noting
that they must ensure "mesh Reynolds number $\simeq1$ for each $\dx$".

We agree that the question of the turbulent Mach number is quite interesting.  
However, these comments make clear that it requires a more thorough analysis 
than space permits in this letter, so we have deferred that analysis to the 
longer paper on these models that we are preparing, and removed the comment 
that the referee objects to as obscure and mostly misleading, as well as the 
accompanying phrase in the abstract.
 
To address the kinetic energy, we have added panel (d) to Figure 2, which shows 
the evolving kinetic energy in comparison to magnetic energy for several of 
our models.  This figure demonstrates the hydrodynamical statistical
steady state of the kinetic energy in our models, showing that the 
time averaged e_K is a suitable scaling parameter. The models show lower 
variance at increased SN rate. This has a physical explanation, in that the 
more sporadic forcing with lower SN rate induces higher intermittency in the 
energetics. Other than Fig 2 (c) and (d) we have retained the scaling with time-averaged
e_K to demonstrate the convergent result of saturation of SSD at about 5% <e_K>. We
have further demonstrated that the kinetic energy density is dependent on resolution,
due to increased numerical dissipation at low resolution. The shape of the 
magnetic energy growth is not impacted by this choice, though.

We have replaced the plots in Figures 2(c) and Figure 4 with a log-linear scale as
suggested. In Figure 2 we have retained the log-log scales for panels
(a) and (b), where we wish to illustrate the convergence with resolution of models 
that have drastically different growth rates and thus time scales. These models
are also included in Figure 4; e.g. the aqua curve in 2(a) corresponds to the
brown dash-dot curve in 4(d1) that shows clean exponential growth. 
The exponential growth is indeed more clearly demonstrated for our models than either
of the Balsara et al. models. This supports our assertion that the increased
accuracy of the Pencil Code, alongside its shock handling tools, make it well
suited for modeling this environment, even without the more exact shock
treatment used by Balsara et al.  In Figure 4 the exponential nature of
the growth is now clearly evident.  While growth rates do vary with time, each
phase of that variation does show straight line, exponential behaviour, and
overall growth for each curve can also adequately be fitted with exponentials.

We have examined the e_B - n 2D histograms of the models from the evolving
snapshots and there is very weak or no correlation between magnetic energy
density and mass density during the kinematic growth. In fact there are phases
when the magnetic field grows most rapidly in the diffuse hot gas. The mean 
value n^(4/3) = 1.6 remains almost constant in time, independent of resolution or
magnetic field strength, as must be true for a periodic domain. At 4 pc resolution 
this value fluctuates up and down between about 1.4 and 1.8 during the kinematic growth
period, but for 0.5 pc resolution it remains more steady near 1.6. Compression 
cannot adequately explain the field amplification by 4 to 6 orders of magnitude 
reported here.

False convergence refers to the suppression of physical effects by numerical
diffusivity over multiple resolutions. The suppression of the dynamo seen at our
lower resolutions is an example of this effect. The hypothesis that there is no
SSD at play is unsupported by the multiple lines of evidence we have presented.

We have clarified the use of our seed and imposed fields in the text.
Our fiducial models use only a random seed field which is at 1 nanoG prior
to the onset of the dynamo. Only in our models with SN rate 8x solar neighborhood 
and resolution chosen to match Balsara et al, do we use an imposed
background field matching theirs. Even here the magnetic energy is amplified
by four orders of magnitude, so we clearly have a kinematic SSD (Fig 2c and
Fig 5b). The magnetic energy is at least 8 orders of magnitude weaker than the
kinetic energy before the SSD begins to evolve. The SSD amplifies the magnetic
energy over six orders of magnitude as evident in all panels of Figure 4, so the
kinematic phase is properly explored. It is quite improbable that 
exploring the kinematic phase further with a yet weaker seed would yield 
qualitatively different evolution.

The deviations from pure exponential behaviour that we find are due to
physical causes in our model, most likely the combination of discrete
energy input from supernovae combined with strongly non-isothermal
energetics.  We will explore this in more detail in subsequent work,
but we do consider the fast but irregular field growth that we find to
be a substantial result of this work that required extremely low numerical
diffusion to identify.

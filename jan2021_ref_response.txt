Dear Editor,

We believe that the reviewer has neglected to sufficiently consider
the material presented in our previous publication on resolution of
strong shocks with the Pencil code (Gent et al. 2020), as well as the
extensive literature on the advantages of the use of the Pencil Code
in dynamo modeling going back to Brandenburg & Sarson (2002) and
Haugen & Brandenburg (2004).  As this is a Letter, we cannot include
all that material in the current paper, but can only summarize and
reference. We address the referee's specific comments in more detail below.

The substantial advantage of using a high-order advection algorithm, even at
the cost of relying on artificial diffusivity for shock capturing, is clearly
demonstrated in the comparison shown in Figure 2c, where we reproduce the
results of a second-order code with a Riemann solver (Balsara et al. 2004)
using grid resolution a full factor of two coarser.

To the general question of how shocks should be resolved, approximate Riemann
solvers indeed provide good shock solutions, but are difficult to couple to
high-order advection algorithms.  The historical alternative is to use some
form of von Neumann & Richtmyer (1950, J. Appl. Phys.) artificial viscosity,
which of course was the original method used to resolve shocks numerically, by
spreading them out sufficiently for them to be solved using the standard
advection algorithm.  The original von Neumann & Richtmyer algorithm only adds
diffusivity proportional to the square of the negative divergence to the
momentum and energy equation in order to ensure conservation across shocks.
The sixth-order Pencil code does require a small amount of mass divergence as
well in order to ensure numerical stability when wall heating occurs from the
interaction of strong shocks, but that is not a particularly desirable aspect
of the algorithm. Although addition of numerical resistivity at shocks was used
in the older paper by Gent et al. (2013), that leads to unphysical loss of flux
at the shock front, and provides no improvement in numerical stability, so
abandoning its use, as was done in Gent et al. (2020), improves the solution
rather than harming it, as well as returning to a more traditional formulation
of artificial viscosity.

We are puzzled why grid-scale numerical instability would be seen as
crucial for shocks.  What is crucial for shocks is to conserve mass,
momentum, and energy across as thin a discontinuity as possible.  The
need for hyperviscosity occurs because the sixth-order advection
formulation provides extremely low numerical viscosity, unlike typical
lower-order algorithms, so some grid scale viscosity must be provided
artificially.  The hyperdiffusion suppresses high frequency numerical
instabilities from growing, ensuring that fluctuations in the physical
variables arise from the resolved physical processes sufficiently
above the grid scale. This is distinct from the large scale physical
feature of a blast wave, which needs to be resolved within a minimal
range of grid spaces as it travels. Shocks are neith resolved nor
suppressed by the hyper diffusion.  The coefficients for
hyperdiffusion should impose a mesh Reynolds number of 1, so they must
vary with resolution. We have clarified this in the text by noting
that they must ensure "mesh Reynolds number $\simeq1$ for each $\dx$".

We agree that the relevance of Mach number is more interesting and requires a
more thorough analysis than space permits in this letter, so we have deferred
comment to our later publications. 
We have added panel (d) to Figure 2 showing the evolving kinetic energy 
by comparison to magnetic energy for some models to demonstrate the statistical
steady kinetic environment for the dynamos, and to demonstrate that the 
time averaged e_K used elsewhere is a suitable scaling. The models are in
hydrodynamical statistical steady state, with lower variance at increased SN
rate. This has a physical explanation, in that the more sporadic forcing with
lower SN rate induces higher intermittency in the energetics.
Other than Fig 2 (c) and (d) we have retained the scaling with time-averaged
e_K to demonstrate the convergent result of saturation of SSD at about 5%. We
have demonstrated that the kinetic energy density is dependent on resolution,
due to increased numerical dissipation at low resolution. The shape of the 
magnetic energy growth is not impacted by this choice.

We have replaced the plots in Figure 4 with a log-linear scale as
suggested. In Figure 2 we have retained the log-log scales for panels
(a) and (b), where we wish to illustrate the convergence with
resolution of models that have drastically different growth rates. These models
are also included in Figure 4; e.g. the aqua curve in 2(a) corresponds to the
brown dash-dot curve in 4(d1) that shows clean exponential growth. Figure 2 (c)
has been replaced with log-linear, as they evolve over comparable timescales.
The exponential growth is more clearly demonstrated for our models than either
of the Balsara et al. models. This supports our assertion that the increased
accuracy of the Pencil Code, alongside its shock handling tools, make it well
suited for modelling this environment, even without the more exact shock
treatment available to Balsara et al.  In Figure 4 the exponential nature of
the growth is now clearly evident.  While growth rates do vary with time, each
phase of that variation does show straight line, exponential behaviour, and
overall growth for each curve can also adequately be fitted with exponentials.

We have examined the e_B - n 2D histograms of the models from the evolving
snapshots and there is very weak or no correlation between magnetic energy
density and mass density during the kinematic growth. In fact there are phases
when the magnetic field grows most rapidly in the diffuse hot gas. The mean 1.6
for n^(4/3) remains almost constant in time, independent of resolution or
magnetic field strength. At 4pc resolution this fluctuates up and down between
about 1.4 and 1.8 during the kinematic growth, but for 0.5pc it remains more
steady near 1.6. Compression cannot adequately explain the field amplification
by 4 to 6 orders of magnitude.

False convergence refers to the suppression of physical effects by numerical
diffusivity over multiple resolutions. The suppression of the dynamo seen at our
lower resolutions is an example of this effect. The supposition that there is no
SSD at play is unsupported by the multiple lines of evidence we have presented.

We have clarified the use of our seed and imposed fields in the text.
Our fiducial models use only a random seed field which is at 1uG prior
to the onset of dynamo. Only in our models with SN
rate 8x and resolution chosen to match Balsara et al, do we use an imposed
background field matching theirs. Even here the magnetic energy is amplified
by four orders of magnitude, so we clearly have a kinematic SSD (Fig 2c and
Fig 5b). The magnetic energy is at least 8 orders of magnitude weaker than the
kinetic energy before the SSD begins to evolve. The SSD amplifies the magnetic
energy over six orders of magnitude as evident in all panels of Figure 4, so the
kinematic phase is properly explored. It is not reasonable to expect that 
exploring the kinematic phase further with a yet weaker seed would yield 
qualitatively different evolution.

The deviations from pure exponentIal behaviour that we find are due to
physical causes in our model, most likely the combination of discrete
energy input from supernovae combined with strongly non-isothermal
energetics.  We will explore this in more detail in subsequent work,
but we do consider the fast but irregular field growth that we find to
be a substantial result of this work that required low numerical
diffusion to identify.

We are disappointed in the referee response. The fundamental disagreement in the
capability of the Pencil Code to model reliably the physics presented has not 
been justified by the referee and the previous and current criticisms of the
Pencil Code have been misdirected. We have confirmed that the assertions of the 
referee regarding the absence of viscosity were misplaced and have demonstrated
in previous work that the shock handling machinery of the code can resolve 
discontinuities with high accuracy and are numerically convergent. The confusion
below between hyper and shock diffusion applicability demonstrates the referee's
lack of insight with respect to the relevance of these tools. We therefore
request a replacement referee.
 
%MJK We could say something like this instead.
We are somewhat disappointed by the slow convergence of opinions with the referee. Our intention, which should also be very clear from the main text itself, is *not* to claim that Pencil Code is the *optimal* tool for such modelling, but we have, in length, demonstrated in earlier publications that it is a *valid* and efficient tool for such modelling. The intention of the letter is to present novel and high-impact results from the simulations, rather than present or advertise the code itself. Our aim is to present the model and simulations to the extent that the paper can be read stand alone from the earlier publication presenting the model in detail, but still contain the essential parts for understanding the core concepts. We feel that the referee's statements of "obscure" and "mysterious" in criticising our model description are inappropriate, but yet we still have tried to improve on those descriptions to appease the referee.

%MJK We should try to make the descriptions clearer, and explain here what we have changed.

%MJK Here, the referee has already decided that the kinetic energy is not a constant - crazy. I suggest we proceed as planned: to show the kinetic energy in an additional panel to Figure 2, and possibly add the Mach number from the sims with a different axis on the right hand side.

%MJK Here we also had a clear plan of action, and I suggest we follow it.

  The ratio (\rho_max/\rho_min)^(2/3) in the domain is at most 4.7e4 at dx=0.5
  and 4.7e3 dx=4. 
  The mean of rho^(4/3) fluctuates around 1.6 between 1.4 and 1.8, independent
  of resolution.

%MJK Here to explain that the initial seed field is already so small, that reducing it further below the floating point accuracy is not necessary. And why does he say "like in section 2"? Anyways, it sounds like for this referee the main problem is still the lack of exponential growth, which we have obviously failed to demonstrate to him convincingly. I feel it is important to make the Balsara comparison plot as convincing as possible.

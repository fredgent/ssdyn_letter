We are disappointed in the referee response. The fundamental disagreement in the
capability of the Pencil Code to model reliably the physics presented has not 
been justified by the referee and the previous and current criticisms of the
Pencil Code have been misdirected. We have confirmed that the assertions of the 
referee regarding the absence of viscosity were misplaced and have demonstrated
in previous work that the shock handling machinery of the code can resolve 
discontinuities with high accuracy and are numerically convergent. The confusion
below between hyper and shock diffusion applicability demonstrates the referee's
lack of insight with respect to the relevance of these tools. We therefore
request a replacement referee.

  The ratio (\rho_max/\rho_min)^(2/3) in the domain is at most 4.7e4 at dx=0.5
  and 4.7e3 dx=4. 
  The mean of rho^(4/3) fluctuates around 1.6 between 1.4 and 1.8, independent
  of resolution.
